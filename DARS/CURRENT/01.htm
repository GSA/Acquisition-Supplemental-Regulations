    <h3 id="purpose.">1.101 Purpose.</h3>
    <p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DARS) establishes uniform DISA policies implementing and supplementing the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), Title 10 of the United States Code (U.S.C.) and other statutory authority, and applicable Department of Defense (DoD) directives and instructions. The DARS is not a stand alone document and must be read in conjunction with the preceding guidance.</p>
    <h3 id="applicability.">201.104 Applicability.</h3>
    <p>The DARS applies to all acquisitions processed or managed by DISA, except where expressly excluded. Policies/procedures of non-DISA mission partners are acceptable as long as they comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example: Requirements office generated documents (acquisition plans, justifications and approvals, etc.) need not be in the DISA format, contain DISA supplemental information, etc.</p>
    <p>DARS policies requiring DISA requirements offices to report to the Director would not be enforced on external mission partners.</p>
    <h3 id="section"></h3>
    <h3 id="copies.">201.105-3 Copies.</h3>
    <p>Copies of the DARS and associated acquisition policies and procedures are available electronically via the DISA Acquisition Policy and Guidance web site: <a href="http://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/aqinfo.asp"><span class="underline">http://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/aqinfo.asp</span>.</a></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>(a) <em>DoD peer reviews.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(1)(i) <em>Competitive acquisitions valued at $1 billion or more</em>. Per Class Deviation 2019-O0010, peer reviews for competitive procurements above $1 billion, as required by DFARS 201.170(a)(1)(i), are no longer required except for procurements of major defense acquisition programs for which the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S)) is the milestone decision authority and USD(A&S) special interest programs. See <a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/peer_reviews.html"><span class="underline">http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/peer_reviews.html</span></a> for additional information on the OSD/DPC (Defense Pricing and Contracting) Peer Review program. Peer reviews and team members will be appointed by DPC. All peer review documentation prepared for DPC-level reviews shall be coordinated with the cognizant Head of the Contracting Office (HCO) and Chief of the Contracting Office (CoCO), and forwarded to PL22 for transmission to DPC.</p>
    <p>(ii) <em>Noncompetitive acquisitions valued at $500 million or more.</em> Peer Review of DISA noncompetitive procurements valued at $500 million or more shall be conducted in accordance with DFARS 201.170(a).</p>
    <p>* Note: If a procurement is solicited as competitive and only one proposal is received, for peer reviews, the procurement moves to a single source environment.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>(b) <em>Component (DISA) peer reviews.</em></p>
        <p>(i) <em>Competitive Acquisitions valued at $500 million or more</em>. The DISA Contracting Peer Review/Independent Management Review Program for Acquisition of Services establishes policy and procedures for conducting Peer Reviews of all solicitations, and contracts with a total estimated contract value (including options) of $500 million or more, for competitive Acquisition of Services only. Communication Service Authorizations (CSAs) issued using the DISA streamlined Inquiry/Quote/ Order (IQO) process or issued against an indefinite delivery type contract are excluded.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(ii) <em>Acquisitions valued below $500 million.</em> CoCOs are encouraged to request inter-DITCO and intra-DITCO pre-solicitation peer reviews below $500M. Inter-DITCO peer reviews will be managed by PL2. Intra-DITCO peer reviews will be managed by the respective CoCO and results will be provided to PL2 (for tracking the conduct of the review and trends).</p>
    <p>(S-90) <em>Peer Review Timelines/Procurement Action Lead Times (PALTs)</em>. During the development of an acquisition plan and/or acquisition strategy, contracting officers (KOs) shall take into account the requirement for scheduling and conducting a Peer Review in accordance with this section. DISA level peer reviews will be accomplished in four (4) business days. The time required for each DISA Peer Review is reflected in the approved PALT times for each contract vehicle and evaluation type (https://www.ditco.disa.mil/contracts/IT_instruct.asp). DISA level peer reviews shall be conducted in conjunction with compliance and legal reviews IAW DARS 1.9000.</p>
    <p>(S-91) <em>Objective.</em> The objective of the DISA Contracting Peer Review/Independent Management Review Program is to (1) ensure that contracting officers across the Procurement Services Directorate (PSD) are implementing law, policy and regulations in a consistent and accurate manner; (2) improve the quality of acquisition and contracting processes across DISA; and (3) share best practices and lessons learned. The findings and recommendations of the peer reviews/independent management reviews are advisory in nature, providing supplemental information to the contracting officer regarding acquisition strategy, contract structure, format, content and compliance. DISA Contracting Peer Review/Independent Management Review Program procedures are established in accordance with OSD Memorandum, Peer Reviews of Contracts for Supplies and Services, dated September 29, 2008, at <a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/peer_reviews.html">http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/peer_reviews.html</a>.</p>
    <p>(1) <strong>Pre-award Peer Reviews</strong> of solicitations shall be conducted for competitive services ($500M or above) prior to issuance of the solicitation (pre-solicitation).</p>
    <p>(2) <strong>Independent Management Reviews</strong> of contracts for services shall be conducted at the following decision points:</p>
    <p>(i) Mid-point of the initial (base) performance period if in excess of three years; and</p>
    <p>(ii) Prior to exercising the first option period of performance and every other option period thereafter.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">All peer review/independent management review documentation shall be marked as Source Selection Information - see FAR 2.101 and 3.104 </span>.</p>
    <p>(S-92) <em>Procedures</em>. The DISA Peer Review/Independent Management Review procedures are located at <a href="https://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/peerreview.asp">https://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/peerreview.asp</a>.</p>
    <p>(S-93) <em>Waivers.</em> If critical mission performance circumstances necessitate the request of a waiver, a Request for Peer Review/Independent Management Review Waiver (<a href="https://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/peerreview.asp">https://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/peerreview.asp</a>) memorandum shall be prepared by the cognizant contracting officer, coordinated through the CoCO and HCO, and submitted to the PL22 Peer Review<span class="underline">/Independent Management Review</span> Program Coordinator. The Peer Review/Independent Management Review Coordinator will coordinate with the PL22 Branch Chief and the appropriate waiver approval authority. Waivers shall be in the same format as the Request for Peer Review/Independent Management Review, with subject line modified to read, Request for Waiver of Peer Review/Independent Management Review for (name of program/project/service) , and shall include a brief explanation as to why a waiver is necessary. Waiver requests shall be approved prior to proceeding with a procurement action without a peer review/independent management review, and may only be approved by the HCA for competitive procurements. For noncompetitive procurements valued over $500 million, waivers must be coordinated through the HCA, and forwarded to OSD/DPC for approval.</p>

    <h3 id="review-and-approval-of-contract-actions."><strong>1.9000 Review and approval of contract actions</strong>.</h3>
    <p>(a) <em>Definitions.</em></p>

    <p> Begin negotiations means starting discussions with an offeror for the purpose of reaching agreement on all aspects of the proposal. Initiation of audits and fact-finding necessary to evaluate the proposal and develop the Government s negotiation objective do not constitute negotiations</p>
    <p> Contract Approval means for competitive acquisitions conducted with or without discussions, approval by the Contract Decision Authority to authorize the contracting officer to award a contract or order. For non-competitive contract actions approval by the Contract Decision Authority is required to award a contract, order or contract modification.</p>
    <p>(b) <em>Exclusions.</em></p>
    <p>(1) An extension modification or contract award as a result of a protest.</p>
    <p>(2) An order issued against an existing contract, BOA or BPA if:</p>
    <p>(i) Prices have been established in the basic indefinite delivery contract, BOA or BPA;</p>
    <p>(ii) All other terms and conditions have been established in the basic indefinite delivery contract, BOA or BPA;</p>
    <p>(iii) The basic contract, BOA or BPA was reviewed and considered legally sufficient by the supporting legal office; and</p>
    <p>(iv) There are no negotiations (i.e., no proposal, formal or informal, is necessary for the order to be issued) involved in the award of the proposed order under the indefinite delivery contract, BOA or BPA.</p>
    <p>(3) Inquiries issued in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/deskbooks.asp">Inquiry/Quote/Order (IQO) Acquisition Deskbook</a>. However, Orders issued in accordance with the IQO process are not excluded from the contract review and approval;</p>
    <p>(4) Contract actions that solely provide incremental funding, incentive fee funding, award fee funding, or other administrative contract modifications.</p>
    <p>(5) Priced options that were previously established in the basic contract/order and that are exercised in accordance with the established prices and terms and conditions of the contract/order.</p>
    <p>(c) <em>Policy, thresholds, and approvals.</em></p>
    <p>Procurement actions are subject to various review levels and thresholds as set forth below.</p>
    <p>HCOs and CoCOs are accountable for procurement quality. HCOs and CoCOs will establish an internal review system to review contract files not less than annually to ensure quality standards are maintained for all procurement actions within their respective offices, including simplified acquisitions. The HCO and/or CoCO is responsible for identifying the quality control measures that are put in place within the DITCO in the Manager's Internal Control Program. The results of the quality inspections will be provided to PL2 for trend analysis, training purposes, and future PMRs.</p>
    <p>(1) The objectives of the review and approval process are to ensure that:</p>
    <p>(i) Contract actions effectively implement approved acquisition strategies;</p>
    <p>(ii) Negotiations and contract actions result in fair and reasonable business arrangements;</p>
    <p>(iii) Negotiations and contract actions are consistent with laws, regulations, and policies; and, (iv) An independent review and assessment for the proposed contract action is accomplished.</p>
    <p>(2) Contract actions meeting the contract value thresholds set in <a href="https://disa.deps.mil/org/PL2/Pages/DITCORefs.aspx">DARS PGI</a> 1.9000(c)(2) shall not be awarded without obtaining the required review approvals.</p>
    <p>(d) General Counsel (GC)/Legal and Policy Compliance Reviews.</p>
    <p>(1) Legal (GC) and Policy Compliance (PL22) reviews shall be obtained prior to submission to the CDA/SSA.</p>
    <p>(i) Legal and Policy Compliance review thresholds. PL83/PL84: $10M for task orders, $10M for supplies / hardware, and $6.5M for all other procurement actions; PLA, PL5, PL6, PL7 and PL82: $6.5M for all procurement actions. All broad agency announcements (BAA) require legal review.</p>
    <p>(ii) Legal and Policy reviews of contracts and task orders using the trade-off evaluation method, regardless of dollar value, are highly encouraged.</p>
    <p>(iii) Legal and Policy reviews can be requested by a contracting officer, CoCO, HCO, or HCA at lower dollar thresholds or for special interest procurements.</p>
    <p>(2) At a minimum, the contracting officer must review the contract file/documentation prior to requesting a legal and policy compliance review. Also, the contract file must be reviewed at least one level above the contracting officer prior to requesting a Legal and Policy compliance review for contract actions greater than or equal to $50M. The contracting officer may submit the request for Legal and Policy compliance review only after all reviewer comments, if any, are resolved.</p>
    <p>(3) Legal and Policy compliance reviews may be requested concurrently. Legal and Policy reviews will be accomplished in four (4) business days. Additional business days may be required to review substantial/numerous documents.</p>
    <p>(i) When Legal or Policy reviews indicate non-compliance with laws, regulations or policies (e.g. a policy critical finding or a GC legally insufficient finding), the contracting officer will revise the procurement documents in collaboration with the assigned attorney-advisor and/or procurement analyst. Legal will copy the CoCO on e-mails which notify a contracting officer of legally insufficient findings, and Policy will copy CoCOs on e-mails which notify a contracting officer of critical findings. A procurement document shall not be released until legally insufficient or critical findings are adjudicated.</p>
    <p>(ii) While changes are expected to be professionally resolved at the lowest possible level, disagreements may be elevated above the contracting officer, through Section and Branch Chiefs to the CoCO, the HCO, and ultimately to the HCA. Legal issues may be elevated to the General Counsel.</p>
    <p>(4) Policy compliance (PL22) reviews ---</p>
    <p>(i) Requests for Policy compliance review shall be sent via email to the DISA Ft Meade PLD Mailbox PL22 Policy Compliance Review group mailbox. The following standard subject line format shall be used: [insert Office Code (i.e., PLX)], [insert Pre-Solicitation , Pre-Award or Post-Award, as appropriate] Policy Compliance Review Request, [insert solicitation, contract/modification, or order/modification number] and [*insert EDMS folder ID number]. Urgent requests for review must also include Expedite in the subject line and shall be forwarded to the PL22 group mailbox by the CoCO. Pertinent information needed to assist the PL22 policy compliance reviewers should be included in the body of the e-mail. For example, provide the EDMS folder ID number, document identifier/description, indicate if a policy compliance review was accomplished at a previous stage of the procurement (and if so, the solicitation number), provide the estimated dollar value of the procurement, etc. See Table 1-3 for a list of required documents. Documents may be submitted as attachments to the email if not available in EDMS.</p>
    <p>*Note: Regardless of the type of review, the EDMS folder identifier used in EDMS at the time of the review request must be included to allow for the automatic storing of the review results.</p>
    <p>(ii) In circumstances where the contracting officer finds it necessary to proceed with issuing a solicitation or awarding a contract action prior to obtaining PL22 policy compliance review as required by the DARS, the contracting officer shall obtain a written waiver from the CoCO. The waiver shall be retained in the official contract file. Policy will review solicitations after-the-fact (i.e., after the solicitation has been issued).</p>
    <p>(iii) Each Policy review comment will be listed under one of the following categories: Administrative, Critical or Recommendation. Below is the definition of each category:</p>
    <p>(A) Administrative is grammar, punctuation, style, etc.</p>
    <p>(B) Critical is when the procurement is non-compliant with the FAR, DFARS, DARS, or DISA prescribed policy or procedure. The reference will be cited and the comment shall be resolved prior to release of a procurement document. The critical comment(s) and disposition are to be filed as part of the contract file.</p>
    <p>(C) Recommendation is proposed by the procurement analyst based upon document content.</p>
    <p>(5) Legal (GC) reviews ---</p>
    <p>(i) Definitions.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">Legally Sufficient</span>: Complies with the applicable laws, regulations and policy.</p>
    <p><span class="underline">Legally Insufficient</span>: Does not comply with the applicable laws, regulations and policy. Generally, these will be accompanied by specific findings and potential alternatives to correct legal deficiencies.</p>
    <p>In addition, Legal may also express its business opinion/advice in support of its reviews beyond the base legal sufficiency determinations above, to include advice on legal and business risks relative to the best interests of the Agency. These opinions constitute advice for consideration of the DISA acquisition team in which the GC is a partner.</p>
    <p>(ii) Legal review comments or a statement that the procurement document has been reviewed and found to be legally sufficient must be placed in the contract file. The contracting officer is responsible for assuring that all legal comments are adjudicated.</p>
    <p>(iii) In circumstances where the contracting officer finds it necessary to proceed with issuing a solicitation or awarding a contract action prior to obtaining a required legal review, the contracting officer shall obtain a written waiver from the CoCO. The waiver shall be retained in the official contract file. The CoCO shall request an emergency/or quick turn-around legal review prior to approving the waiver. Legal will not review solicitations and contract award actions that have been waived (i.e., after-the-fact reviews).</p>
    <p>(iv) DITCO-Pacific (PL7), DITCO-Scott Telecommunications Contracting Division (PL82), DITCO-Scott IT Contracting Division (PL83), and DITCO-Scott Emerging Technology, Special Interest Contracts, and Pricing (PL84) shall obtain legal reviews from legal counsel located at DITCO-Scott. DITCO-National Capital Region (PL6), DITCO-Europe (PL5), Special Access Programs, and WHCA shall obtain legal reviews from legal counsel located at NCR.</p>
    <p>(v) Requests for legal review from legal counsel located at DITCO-Scott shall be sent via email to the DISA Scott AFB DITCO Mailbox Legal Office group mailbox. Requests for legal reviews from legal counsel located at DITCO-NCR shall be sent via email to the DISA Ft Meade GC Mailbox Acquisition Law Team group mailbox. The following standard subject line format shall be used: [insert Office Code (i.e., PLX)], [insert Pre-Solicitation , Pre-Award Contract Approval or Contract Approval as appropriate] Legal Review Request, [insert solicitation, contract/modification, or order/modification number]. The contracting officer or specialist shall provide legal counsel with the documents necessary to complete the review.</p>
