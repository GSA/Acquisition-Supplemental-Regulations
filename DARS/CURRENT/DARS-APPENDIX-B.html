The reviews are to ensure the clauses do not contain material differences from those already authorized for use and that circumstances for use of the provisions and clauses are appropriate. These provisions and clauses will be included in DISA Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DARS).</p>
<p>c. Proposed tailoring of clauses, use of alternates, and authorized deviations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Contracting Officer, PL21, and the DISA Office of General Counsel to ensure proper use and that the alternate language is authorized prior to being included in solicitations and contracts.</p>

<p>7. <em>Controls</em></p>
