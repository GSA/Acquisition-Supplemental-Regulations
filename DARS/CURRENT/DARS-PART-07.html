<p class="BodyText"><em>Component Acquisition Executive (CAE).</em> The CAE has oversight and review authority for all acquisition matters. The CAE has the authority and is accountable for all acquisition functions and activities in the Agency. (Source: DISAI 610-225- 2)</p>
<p class="BodyText"><em>Procurement Services Executive (PSE).</em> Serves as the DISA HCA.</p>

<p class="BodyText"><em>High-Risk Contract Line Item Numbers (CLIN)</em>. CR, T&amp;M, and LH CLINs. When a combination of CLIN types are used (sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo;), the contract is considered high-risk if the high-risk CLINs constitute 50% or more of the total estimated cost. </p>
<p class="BodyText"><em>Integrated Product (or Process) Team (IPT).</em> A cross-functional team formed for the specific purpose of delivering a capability for an external or internal mission partner.</p>
<p class="BodyText"><em>Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).</em> The IGCE is a required evaluation tool in DISA source selections.

The senior official responsible for ensuring that a proposed services acquisition is consistent with DoD&rsquo;s policies, procedures, and best practices guidelines for the acquisition of services. The DA is responsible to identify, assess, validate, and approve services acquisition requirements within delegated thresholds. The approval of a requirement allows prioritization of mission requirements to best support mission needs within available funding limits.</p>
