Proposed tailoring of clauses, use of alternates, and authorized deviations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Contracting Officer, PL21, and the DISA Office of General Counsel to ensure proper use and that the alternate language is authorized prior to being included in solicitations and contracts.  </p>
