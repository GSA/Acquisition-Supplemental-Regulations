The face value of this action is <i>(insert $ amount) </i>funded by <i>(insert FY of funds and type of appropriation).

<p align="center"><b>SOURCE SELECTION INFORMATION &#8211; See FAR 2.101 and 3.104</b></p>

<p>(2)  When an updated congressional notice is required (e.g. due to the change in the period of performance), include the pertinent information that changed from the original notice to the updated notice.   Explicitly describe the contract action / modification and state what information was revised (e.g. &#8216;The revised period of performance is...&#8217;).   When an update is required, the original notification and the update should be sent to DISA Public Affairs in accordance with 205.303(S-94)(1).</p>

<p>(S-93)  PMs shall use the same format as above for &#8220;Notifications&#8221; except that the title of the document should be changed to &#8220;Press Notification,&#8221; the contracting activity name should be changed to properly reflect the non-DISA contracting activity and the contracting point of contact should be changed to reflect the DISA PM point of contact information.</p>

<p>(S-94)  Procedures.</p>

<p>(1)  The contracting officer must prepare and submit the Notification via email to the respective CoCO.   The CoCO must review and approve all Notifications prior to email submission to the DISA Public Affairs, DISA General Counsel (GC), and the HCA.  The CoCO will submit the Notification (in accordance with the format at DARS 5.303(S-92)) via email concurrently to</p>

<p>the DISA Public Affairs (Outlook email address: <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .mailto:disa.meade.bd.mbx.public-affairs@mail.mil. --><a href="mailto:disa.meade.bd.mbx.public-affairs@mail.mil" target="_top">DISA Ft Meade BD Mailbox Public Affairs</a></u></font>) and DISA GC (Outlook email address: <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .mailto:disa.scott.ditco.mbx.legal-office@mail.mil. --><a href="mailto:disa.scott.ditco.mbx.legal-office@mail.mil" target="_top">DISA Scott AFB DITCO Mailbox Legal Office</a></u></font> or <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .mailto:disa.meade.gc.mbx.acquisition-law-team@mail.mil. --><a href="mailto:disa.meade.gc.mbx.acquisition-law-team@mail.mil" target="_top">DISA Ft Meade GC Mailbox Acquisition Law Team</a></u></font>).  The CoCO will also provide a courtesy copy to the HCO and HCA via email.  Submissions must be made in sufficient time so that the DISA Public Affairs, DISA GC, and HCA receive it at least three business days before the award date provided in the Notification.</p>

<p>(2)  For actions funded by DISA but awarded by another agency, the PM must prepare and submit the Press Notification via email to the external contracting officer (for the contract file) and to the DISA PAO (for their coordination with the appropriate external agency's contracting organization's PAO to OSD PA for DoD announcement).  The PM shall also forward the PM Notification to the DISA Director (D) or Vice Director (DV) via email.  The D or DV may elect to notify the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer.</p>

<p>(3)  To preclude the inadvertent release of the Notification prior to the actual award date and to ensure Agency compliance with the FAR 5.303(a) requirement to make the public announcement by 5:00 p.m. Washington, DC time on the day of award, contracting officers must execute contract award on the date provided in the Notification.</p>

<p>(4)  The DISA PAO shall notify the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) and DISA GC shall notify Congress.  The DISA GC shall coordinate notifications of contractual actions with DISA Congressional Affairs before release to Congress to the extent possible.</p>

<p>(S-90)  Communication of Acquisition Strategy Information to Industry.</p>

<p>(1)  For acquisitions with an estimated total lifecycle exceeding $50M, when a Sources Sought (SS) Announcement or Request for Information (RFI) has posted to FedBizOpps (FBO), the contracting officer shall update the FBO announcement to identify the acquisition strategy once market research has been completed and the strategy has been approved.  Similar notifications are encouraged, but not required, for acquisitions with an estimated total lifecycle below $50M.</p>

<p>(2)  At a minimum, the update should include the following information:</p>

<p>(i)  Contract vehicle (e.g., Federal Supply Schedule, Government-wide Acquisition Contract, Multiple-Award Contract, or Blanket Purchase Agreement) that will be leveraged to solicit the acquisition, if applicable.  If utilizing Federal Supply Schedules, include the specific Schedule number and Special Item Number(s) under which the requirement will be announced.</p>

<p>(ii)  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code selected for the acquisition.</p>

<p>(iii)  Identification of small business set-aside to include the specific socio-economic category, if applicable.</p>

<p>(iv)  Projected time frame for Request for Proposal (RFP)/ Request for Quotation (RFQ) posting.</p>

<p>(S-91)  Proactive Updates to Interested Parties after Receipt of Proposals / Quotations.</p>

<p>(1)  For acquisitions with an estimated total lifecycle value exceeding $50M, the contracting officer shall notify interested parties of the projected award date approximately 30 calendar days prior to the anticipated date of award.  Source selection information shall not be provided with this notification.  Similar notifications are encouraged, but not required, for acquisitions with an estimated total lifecycle below $50M.</p>

<p>(2)  In instances where the projected award date will be after the period of performance start date specified in the solicitation, the contracting officer shall provide notification to interested parties.  The notification shall include a new projected award date, via amended solicitation and/or update to the announcement, at the point at which it is apparent that award will not be made by the date(s) specified in the solicitation.  Contracting officers may provide additional status updates as appropriate for their acquisition.</p>

<p>(3)  Notifications to interested parties shall clearly articulate that the purpose of the notification is solely to provide interested parties with status information for the subject procurement and the Government is not soliciting feedback or proposals/quotations as a result of the notification.  Notifications shall be reviewed by the assigned legal counsel prior to release.  Notification requirements may be waived in writing by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) (or Contract Decision Authority (CDA)).  In instances where the contracting officer is the SSA (or CDA), approval to waive the notification requirement resides with the Chief of the Contracting Office (CoCO).</p>

<p>(S-90)  Upon Receipt of a congressional request, the contracting officer shall report the request to their CoCO and HCO immediately, if the request was not received from the HCO.  The HCO will notify the PSD Front Office for further guidance.</p>

<p>(S-91)  Once guidance is received, the contracting officer shall prepare the congressional response in accordance with the Congressional Template located at <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .https://www.ditco.disa.mil/DITCOContractingTemplates/. --><a href="https://www.ditco.disa.mil/DITCOContractingTemplates/" target="_top">https://www.ditco.disa.mil/DITCOContractingTemplates/</a></u></font>.
