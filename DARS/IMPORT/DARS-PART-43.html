The usage amounts will also be reported via a contract action report in FPDS-NG and auto-filed in IDEAS. A CLIN will be used for usage charges in telecommunications contracts/orders. SLINs will be added under the usage CLIN via the automatic modifications each month to report obligation amounts.

<p class="List1">(S-90) When issuing a modification to an existing contract, order or task order made under FAR Parts 8, 14, 15, or 16, that requires a change to the scope of work to be performed, the contracting officer shall determine if the change falls within scope of the contract, order or task order. The contracting officer shall consider the following in making this determination:</p>
<p class="List3">(i) Nature of work to be performed under the modification compared to the nature of the work performed under existing contract or task order;</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) Amount of effort required to perform the work required by the modification compared to the amount of effort required to perform the existing contract or task order;</p>
<p class="List3">(iii) Changes in quantity or quality of deliverables which exceed what offerors who proposed on the existing contract or task order should have reasonably contemplated;</p>
<p class="List3">(iv) Scope of the original competition and whether offerors who proposed on the existing contract or task order should have reasonably contemplated the proposed modification;</p>
<p class="List3">(v) Cumulative impact of multiple changes/previous modifications;</p>
<p class="List3">(vi) Changes in time of performance.</p>
<p class="BodyText">For further guidance on determining when a modification is within scope of an existing contract, see DISA&rsquo;s supplementary guidance at <a href="https://disa.deps.mil/org/PL2/Pages/DITCORefs.aspx">DARS PGI</a> 43.9000(S-90).</p>
<p class="List1">(S-91) Scope determinations are not required for administrative changes issued as modifications that do not impact the substantive rights of the parties (e.g. a change in the paying office or the appropriation data) (FAR 43.101) or unilateral modifications that are authorized by clauses other than the changes clause (e.g. Property clause, Options clause, or Suspension of Work Clause (FAR 43.103(b)(3)).</p>
<p class="List1">(S-92) The contracting officer&rsquo;s scope determination shall be documented as a memorandum for the record (MFR) which cites this DARS subpart. The MFR should confirm the factors in 43.9000 S-90 were taken into consideration in making the determination, whether counsel was consulted, and state the final &ldquo;determination&rdquo; of the contracting officer.</p>
<p class="List1">(S-93) General Counsel shall be consulted in cases where the contracting officer cannot make a clear determination whether the proposed modification is within scope of the existing contract or</p>
<p>task order.</p>
<p class="List1">(S-94) In-scope changes to an existing contract shall be issued in accordance with FAR 43.2. When a proposed change requires a modification outside of the general scope of a contract, the contracting officer must either</p>
<p class="List3">(i) competitively solicit the requirement; or,</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) issue the modification in accordance with the non-competitive procedures at FAR, 6.303, 8.405-6, or 16.505(b)(2).</p>
