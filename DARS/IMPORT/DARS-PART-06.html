<p class="List1">(d) Limitations.</p>
<p class="List1">(S-90) The HCA has waived the requirement to issue a Request for Information (RFI) or Sources Sought (SS) notice as a market research method (see DARS 210.001 (S-90)) for procurement actions to increase the ceiling amount of a contract, bridge actions, or procurement actions as a result of a protest. </p>

Use of an RFI does not meet the requirements at FAR 5.207(c)(15), (16) and FAR 6.302-1(d)(2), a separate notice of proposed contract action is required if a sole source procurement will result from the requirement described in an RFI.</p>
