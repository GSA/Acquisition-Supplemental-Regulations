<p class="PlainText"><em>Bridge Contract </em>is a short-term sole-source contract awarded generally to the incumbent contractor to continue critical services when a follow-on competitive contract action could not be completed in a timely manner. It provides needed services until the program and contracting offices can establish a new competitive contract. The SPE Bridge Decision Briefing, located in <a href="https://disa.deps.mil/org/PL2/Pages/DITCORefs.aspx">DARS PGI</a><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em> </em></span>17.000, is not required for non-DISA contract actions nor is it required for bridge contracts made necessary by GAO or Agency-level protests. Although a bridge may not require a decision brief, it still must be added onto the Bridge Chart at: <a href="https://disa.deps.mil/org/PL2/Lists/BridgeChart/AllItems.aspx">https://disa.deps.mil/org/PL2/Lists/BridgeChart/AllItems.aspx</a>.</p>

<p class="List1">(c) This subpart does not apply to:</p>

<h3 class="Heading3">
<a id="_Toc41468015"></a>17.501 General.</h3>
<p class="List1">(S-90) DITCO is the organic contracting activity of DISA. DISA activities shall only use the contracting services of DITCO to acquire all required supplies and services, unless the use of another agency&rsquo;s contracting services (an interagency assisted acquisition) has been determined to be in the best interest of the government. Only DITCO is authorized to approve interagency acquisitions on behalf of DISA, except as noted in 17.503(e).</p>
<p class="List1">(S-91) Further guidance on how to conduct interagency acquisitions can be found in the DISA Interagency Acquisition Guide located at <span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>https://www.ditco.disa.mil/download.asp?/DITCOContractingTemplates/docs/interagency_acqui</em> <em>sition_guide.docx</em></span>.</p>

<p class="List1">(e) Determinations that the requested work falls within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort, or special competency of the Federally Funded Research &amp; Development Center (FFRDC), and will not place the FFRDC in direct competition with domestic private industry, shall be prepared in writing by the Commander, Principal Director, or Deputy Principal Director of the requiring activity. No DISA official shall cause DISA to enter into a contract directly with any FFRDC (i.e., not an interagency acquisition through the sponsoring agency) unless such contract is executed in accordance with all applicable provisions of the law, including, without limitation, all relevant Federal procurement statutes, the FAR, the DFARS, and the DARS, that would apply to a contract with any other private entity. DISA officials may, however, execute interagency acquisitions with or through an FFRDC sponsoring agency to obtain the services of an FFRDC in accordance with this subpart.</p>
