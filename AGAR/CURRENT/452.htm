<p>       (a) <u>General Instructions.</u>  Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation shall be furnished in the following format with the numbers of copies as specified below.  </p>

<p>            (1) The proposal must include a technical proposal and business proposal.  Each of the parts shall be separate and complete so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently from evaluation of the other.  The technical proposal must not contain reference to cost; however, resource information (such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc.) must be contained in the technical proposal so that the contractor's understanding of the statement of work may be evaluated.  </p>

<p>            (2) Offerors may, at their discretion, submit alternate proposals or proposals which deviate from the requirement; provided, that an offeror also submit a proposal for performance of the work as specified in the statement of work.  Any &quot;alternate&quot; proposal may be considered if overall performance would be improved or not compromised, and if it is in the best interest of the Government.  Alternate proposals, or deviations from any requirement of this RFP, must be clearly identified.</p>

<p>            (3) The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in Section M of this RFP.</p>

<p>       (b) <u>Technical Proposal Instructions.</u>  The technical proposal will be used to make an evaluation and arrive at a determination as to whether the proposal will meet the requirements of the Government.  Therefore, the technical proposal must present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the requirements and a detailed, description of the techniques, procedures and program for achieving the objectives of the specifications/statement of work.  Proposals which merely paraphrase the requirements of the Government's specifications/statement of work, or use such phrases as &quot;will comply&quot; or &quot;standard techniques will be employed&quot; will be considered unacceptable and will not be considered further.  As a minimum, the proposal </p>

<p>must clearly provide the following: (<u>Contracting Officer shall identify in this section the minimum information required to evaluate each technical evaluation factor listed in Section M</u>.)</p>

<p>(c) <u>Business Proposal Instructions.</u></p>

<p>     (1) Cost Proposal.</p>

<p>     In addition to any other requirements for cost/pricing information required in clause FAR 52.215-20, Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (OCT 1997), the following is required:</p>

<p>(<u>Contracting Officer shall identify additional information required if appropriate</u>.)</p>

<p>     (2) Business Proposal.</p>

<p>(b) Fire Suppression Costs. The Contractor's obligations for cost of fire suppression vary according to three classifications of fires as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Operations Fire. An “operations fire” is a fire caused by the Contractor's operations other than a negligent fire. The Contractor agrees to reimburse Forest Service for such cost for each operations fire, subject to a maximum dollar amount of [Contracting Officer insert amount]. The cost of the Contractor's actions, supplies, and equipment on any such fire, or otherwise provided at the request of Forest Service, shall be credited toward such maximum. If the Contractor's actual cost exceeds contractor's obligation stated above, Forest Service shall reimburse the contractor for the excess.</p>

<p>(2) Negligent Fire. A “negligent fire” is a fire caused by the negligence or fault of the Contractor's operations including, but not limited to, one caused by smoking by persons engaged in the Contractor's operations during the course of their employment, or during rest or lunch periods; or if the Contractor's failure to comply with requirements under this contract results in a fire starting, or permits a fire to spread. Damages and the cost of suppressing negligent fires shall be borne by the Contractor.</p>

<p>(3) Other Fires on Contract Area. Forest Service shall pay the Contractor, at firefighting rates common in the area or at prior agreed rates, for equipment or personnel furnished by the Contractor at the request of Forest Service, on any fire on contract area other than an operations fire or a negligent fire.</p>

<p>(c) Contractor's Responsibility for Notification in Case of Fire. The Contractor shall immediately notify the Government of any fires sighted on or in the vicinity of the work site.</p>

<p>(d) Contractor's Responsibility for Responding to Emergencies. When directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall temporarily redirect employees and equipment from the work site for emergency work (anticipated to be restricted to firefighting). This is considered to be within the general scope of the contract. An equitable adjustment for any such redirection of employees and equipment will be made under the FAR clause at 52.243-4, Changes.</p>

<p>(e) Performance by the Contractor. Where the Contractor's employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or their employees or agents perform the Contractor's operations in connection with fire responsibilities, the Contractor's obligations shall be the same as if performance was by Contractor.</p>

<p>(f) State Law. The Contractor shall not be relieved by the terms of this contract of any liability to the United States for fire suppression costs recovered in an action based on State law, except for such costs resulting from operations fires. Amounts due to the Contractor for firefighting expenditures on operations fires shall not be withheld pending settlement of any such claim or action based on State law.</p>
