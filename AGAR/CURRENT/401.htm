<p align="center"><a name="P7_87"></a><b>PART 401</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>AGRICULTURE ACQUISITION REGULATION SYSTEM</b></p>

<p><a name="P13_136"></a><b>401.000  Scope of Part.</b></p>

<p>This part presents basic policies and general information about the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Acquisition Regulation, subsequently referred to as the AGAR.  The AGAR is an integral part of the Federal Acquisition Regulations System. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="P17_401"></a><b>SUBPART 401.1--PURPOSE, AUTHORITY, ISSUANCE</b></p>

<p><a name="P19_444"></a><b>401.101  Purpose.</b></p>

<p>(a) The AGAR provides for the codification and publication of uniform policies and procedures for acquisitions by contracting activities within USDA. </p>

<p>(b) The purpose of the AGAR is to implement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), where further implementation is needed, and to supplement the FAR when coverage is needed for subject matter not covered in the FAR.  The AGAR is not by itself  a complete document, as it must be used in conjunction with the FAR.</p>

<p><a name="P25_926"></a><b>401.103  Authority.</b></p>

<p>The AGAR and amendments thereto are issued under 5 U.S.C. 301 and 40 U.S.C. 486(c).  The Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) has the delegated authority to promulgate Departmental acquisition regulations.</p>

<p><a name="P29_1148"></a><b>401.104  Applicability.</b></p>

<p>The FAR and AGAR apply to all USDA acquisitions of supplies and services (including construction) which obligate appropriated funds, unless otherwise specified in this chapter or excepted by law. </p>

<p><a name="P33_1367"></a><b>401.105  Issuance.</b></p>

<p><a name="P35_1385"></a><b>401.105-1  Publication and code arrangement.</b></p>

<p>(a) The AGAR is codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as Chapter 4 of Title 48, Federal Acquisition Regulations System, to implement and supplement Chapter 1 which constitutes the FAR.  Parts 400 through 499 have been assigned to USDA by the Office of the Federal Register.</p>

<p>(b) The AGAR and its subsequent changes are published in: (1) daily issues of the Federal Register, (2) cumulative form in the CFR, and (3) electronic form on the USDA Departmental Administration Procurement Homepage (see AGAR <font color="#0000ff"><a href="401.htm#P100_3715"><u>401.170</u></a></font>).</p>

  <blockquote><p>(c) Section 553(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, provides an exception from the standard public rulemaking procedures to the extent that the rule involves a matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, orcontracts.  In 1971, Secretary of Agriculture Hardin announced a voluntary partial waiver from the Administrative Procedure Act exception,  and USDA agencies generally are required to provide notice and an opportunity for public comment  on proposed rules (36 FR 13804, July 24, 1971).    The AGAR has been promulgated and may be revised from time to time in accordance with the rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.   The USDA also is required to publish for public comment procurement regulations in the Federal Register, pursuant to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 418b), and <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#b1301. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.htm#P893_29218"><u>FAR 1.301</u></a></font>.</p>

</blockquote><p><a name="P43_2864"></a><b>401.105-2  Arrangement of regulations.</b></p>

<p>AGAR coverage parallels the FAR in format, arrangement, and numbering system.  However, subdivisions below the section and subsection levels may not always correlate directly to FAR designated paragraphs and subparagraphs.</p>

<p><a name="P47_3124"></a><b>401.105-3  Copies.</b></p>

<p>Copies of the AGAR published in CFR form may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.  Requests should reference Chapter 4 of Title 48 CFR.</p>

<p>(a) <u>Definitions.</u>  &quot;Ratification,&quot; as used in this section, means the signed, documented action taken by an authorized official to approve and sanction a previously unauthorized commitment.</p>

<p>&quot;Unauthorized commitment,&quot; as used in this section, means an agreement made by a Government representative who lacked the authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the Government.</p>

<p>(c) <u>Procedure.</u>  Whenever an official of the cognizant contracting activity who is authorized to ratify unauthorized commitments learns that a person or firm has assumed work as a result of an unauthorized commitment, that official shall take the following actions:</p>

<p>(1) Immediately inform any person who is performing work as a result of an unauthorized commitment that the work is being performed at that person's risk;</p>

<p>(2) Inform the individual who made the unauthorized commitment of the seriousness of the act and the possible consequences;</p>

<p>(3) Ensure that the individual who made the unauthorized commitment furnishes all records and documents concerning the commitment and a complete, written statement of facts, including, but not limited to: a statement as to why a contracting officer was not used; why the vendor was selected and a list of sources considered; a description of work to be performed or products to be furnished; the estimated or agreed price; whether an appropriation is available for the work; and whether performance has begun. Under exceptional circumstances, such as when the individual who made the unauthorized commitment is no longer available to attest to the circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, the ratifying official may waive these requirements; and</p>
