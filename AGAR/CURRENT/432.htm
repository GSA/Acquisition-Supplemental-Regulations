<p>(b) The SPE will determine whether the contractor has contracts with other Departments or contracting activities and will involve them, as necessary, in the decision making process.</p>

<p>(c) The OIG will determine the need for and the extent of an investigation.</p>

<p>(d) Immediately upon completion of the OIG investigation (or, if deemed necessary by the OIG and the SPE, before completion of the investigation) the SPE, in coordination with the HCA, the contracting officer, and the OIG, shall make a report on the action to the RCO.</p>

<p>(g) This determination will be provided to the contractor and to the SPE for distribution to the agencies involved and for appropriate action under the determination.</p>
