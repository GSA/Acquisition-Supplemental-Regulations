<p>As prescribed at <font color="#0000ff" size="+1"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .2004.doc#s2004404. --><a href="[rp:link:nrcar-part-2004]">§2004.404</a></u></font>(a), the contracting officer shall insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts during which the contractor may have access to, or contact with classified information, including National Security information, restricted data, formerly restricted data, and other classified data:</p>

<p align="center">Security (Oct 1999)</p>

<p>(a) Security/Classification Requirements Form. The attached NRC Form 187 (See List of Attachments) furnishes the basis for providing security and classification requirements to prime contractors, subcontractors, or others (e.g., bidders) who have or may have an NRC contractual relationship that requires access to classified information or matter, access on a continuing basis (in excess of 90 or more days) to NRC Headquarters controlled buildings, or otherwise requires NRC photo identification or card-key badges.</p>

<p>(b) It is the contractor's duty to safeguard National Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data. The contractor shall, in accordance with the Commission's security regulations and requirements, be responsible for safeguarding National Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data, and for protecting against sabotage, espionage, loss, and theft, the classified documents and material in the contractor's possession in connection with the performance of work under this contract. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this contract, the contractor shall transmit to the Commission any classified matter in the possession of the contractor or any person under the contractor's control in connection with performance of this contract upon completion or termination of this contract. </p>

<p>(1) The contractor shall complete a certificate of possession to be furnished to the Commission specifying the classified matter to be retained if the retention is:</p>

<p>(i) Required after the completion or termination of the contract; and</p>

<p>(ii) Approved by the contracting officer.</p>

<p>(2) The certification must identify the items and types or categories of matter retained, the conditions governing the retention of the matter and their period of retention, if known. If the retention is approved by the contracting officer, the security provisions of the contract continue to be applicable to the matter retained.</p>

<p>(c) In connection with the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor may be furnished, or may develop or acquire, proprietary data (trade secrets) or confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information, including Commission plans, policies, reports, financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579), or other information which has not been released to the public or has been determined by the Commission to be otherwise exempt from disclosure to the public. The contractor agrees to hold the information in confidence and not to directly or indirectly duplicate, disseminate, or disclose the information, in whole or in part, to any other person or organization except as necessary to perform the work under this contract. The contractor agrees to return the information to the Commission or otherwise dispose of it at the direction of the contracting officer. Failure to comply with this clause is grounds for termination of this contract.</p>

<p>(d) Regulations. The contractor agrees to conform to all security regulations and requirements of the Commission which are subject to change as directed by the NRC Division of Facilities and Security and the Contracting Officer. These changes will be under the authority of the FAR Changes clause referenced in Section I of this document. </p>

<p>(e) Definition of National Security Information. As used in this clause, the term National Security Information means information that has been determined pursuant to Executive Order 12958 or any predecessor order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and that is so designated.</p>

<p>(f) Definition of Restricted Data. As used in this clause, the term Restricted Data means all data concerning design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; the production of special nuclear material; or the use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, but does not include data declassified or removed from the Restricted Data category under to Section 142 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.</p>

<p>(g) Definition of Formerly Restricted Data. As used in this clause the term Formerly Restricted Data means all data removed from the Restricted Data category under Section 142-d of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.</p>

<p>(h) Security clearance personnel. The contractor may not permit any individual to have access to Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, or other classified information, except in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations or requirements applicable to the particular type or category of classified information to which access is required. The contractor shall also execute a Standard Form 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement, when access to classified information is required.</p>

<p>(i) Criminal liabilities. Disclosure of National Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data relating to the work or services ordered hereunder to any person not entitled to receive it, or failure to safeguard any Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, or any other classified matter that may come to the contractor or any person under the contractor's control in connection with work under this contract, may subject the contractor, its agents, employees, or subcontractors to criminal liability under the laws of the United States. (See the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.; 18 U.S.C. 793 and 794; and Executive Order 12958.)</p>

<p>(j) Subcontracts and purchase orders. Except as otherwise authorized, in writing, by the contracting officer, the contractor shall insert provisions similar to the foregoing in all subcontracts and purchase orders under this contract.</p>

<p>(k) In performing contract work, the contractor shall classify all documents, material, and equipment originated or generated by the contractor in accordance with guidance issued by the Commission. Every subcontract and purchase order issued under the contract that involves originating or generating classified documents, material, and equipment must provide that the subcontractor or supplier assign the proper classification to all documents, material, and equipment in accordance with guidance furnished by the contractor.</p>

The clause may be altered to reflect any special conditions to be applied to foreign nationals:</p>

<p align="center">Site Access Badge Requirements (Jan 1993)</p>

<p>During the life of this contract, the rights of ingress and egress for contractor personnel must be made available as required. In this regard, all contractor personnel whose duties under this contract require their presence on-site shall be clearly identifiable by a distinctive badge furnished by the Government. The Project Officer shall assist the contractor in obtaining the badges for contractor personnel. It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to ensure that each employee has proper identification at all times. All prescribed identification must be immediately delivered to the Security Office for cancellation or disposition upon the termination of employment of any contractor personnel. Contractor personnel shall have this identification in their possession during on-site performance under this contract. It is the contractor's duty to assure that contractor personnel enter only those work areas necessary for performance of contract work and to assure the safeguarding of any Government records or data that contractor personnel may come into contact with. </p>

<p align="center">Current/Former Agency Employee Involvement (Oct 1999)</p>

<p>(a) The following representation is required by the NRC Acquisition Regulation 2009.105-70(b). It is not NRC policy to encourage offerors and contractors to propose current/former agency employees to perform work under NRC contracts and as set forth in the above cited provision, the use of such employees may, under certain conditions, adversely affect NRC's consideration of non-competitive proposals and task orders.</p>

<p>(b) There ( ) are ( ) are no current/former NRC employees (including special Government employees performing services as experts, advisors, consultants, or members of advisory committees) who have been or will be involved, directly or indirectly, in developing the offer, or in negotiating on behalf of the offeror, or in managing, administering, or performing any contract, consultant agreement, or subcontract resulting from this offer. For each individual so identified, the Technical and Management proposal must contain, as a separate attachment, the name of the individual, the individual's title while employed by the NRC, the date individual left NRC, and a brief description of the individual's role under this proposal.</p>

<p>(a) If the representation, as completed, indicates that situations or relationships of the type set forth in 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b) are involved, or the contracting officer otherwise determines that potential organizational conflicts of interest exist, the offeror shall provide a statement in writing that describes in a concise manner all relevant factors bearing on his representation to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer determines that organizational conflicts exist, the following actions may be taken:</p>

<p>(1) Impose appropriate conditions which avoid such conflicts;</p>

<p>(2) Disqualify the offeror; or</p>

<p>(3) Determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to seek award of the contract under the waiver provisions of 48 CFR 2009-570-9.</p>

<p>(b) The refusal to provide the representation required by 48 CFR 2009.570-4(b), or upon request of the contracting officer, the facts required by 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b), must result in disqualification of the offeror for award. </p>

<p align="center">Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest (Jan 1993)</p>

<p>(a) Purpose. The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in ensuring that the contractor: </p>

<p>(1) Is not placed in a conflicting role because of current or planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) which relate to the work under this contract; and </p>

<p>(2) Does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.</p>

<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described apply to performance or participation by the contractor, as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2 in the activities covered by this clause.</p>

<p>(c) Work for others. </p>

<p>(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, during the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to forego entering into consulting or other contractual arrangements with any firm or organization the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest with respect to the work being performed under this contract. The contractor shall ensure that all employees under this contract abide by the provision of this clause. If the contractor has reason to believe, with respect to itself or any employee, that any proposed consultant or other contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, the contractor shall obtain the written approval of the contracting officer before the execution of such contractual arrangement.</p>

<p>(2) The contractor may not represent, assist, or otherwise support an NRC licensee or applicant undergoing an NRC audit, inspection, or review where the activities that are the subject of the audit, inspection, or review are the same as or substantially similar to the services within the scope of this contract (or task order as appropriate) except where the NRC licensee or applicant requires the contractor's support to explain or defend the contractor's prior work for the utility or other entity which NRC questions.</p>

<p>(3) When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site, the contractor shall neither solicit nor perform work in the same or similar technical area for that licensee or applicant organization for a period commencing with the award of the task order or beginning of work on the site (if not a task order contract) and ending one year after completion of all work under the associated task order, or last time at the site (if not a task order contract).</p>

<p>(4) When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site,</p>

<p>(i) The contractor may not solicit work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate.</p>

<p>(ii) The contractor may not perform work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate, and for one year thereafter.</p>

<p>(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contracting officer may authorize the contractor to solicit or perform this type of work (except work in the same or similar technical area) if the contracting officer determines that the situation will not pose a potential for technical bias or unfair competitive advantage.</p>

<p>(d) Disclosure after award.</p>

<p>(1) The contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in this contract, that it does not have any organizational conflicts of interest as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2.</p>

<p>(2) The contractor agrees that if, after award, it discovers organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This statement must include a description of the action which the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate such conflicts. The NRC may, however, terminate the contract if termination is in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<p>(3) It is recognized that the scope of work of a task-order-type contract necessarily encompasses a broad spectrum of activities. Consequently, if this is a task-order-type contract, the contractor agrees that it will disclose all proposed new work involving NRC licensees or applicants which comes within the scope of work of the underlying contract. Further, if this contract involves work at a licensee or applicant site, the contractor agrees to exercise diligence to discover and disclose any new work at that licensee or applicant site. This disclosure must be made before the submission of a bid or proposal to the utility or other regulated entity and must be received by the NRC at least 15 days before the proposed award date in any event, unless a written justification demonstrating urgency and due diligence to discover and disclose is provided by the contractor and approved by the contracting officer. The disclosure must include the statement of work, the dollar value of the proposed contract, and any other documents that are needed to fully describe the proposed work for the regulated utility or other regulated entity. NRC may deny approval of the disclosed work only when the NRC has issued a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or has plans to issue a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or when the work violates paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section.</p>

<p>(e) Access to and use of information.</p>

<p>(1) If, in the performance of this contract, the contractor obtains access to information, such as NRC plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), the contractor agrees not to:</p>

<p>(i) Use this information for any private purpose until the information has been released to the public;</p>

<p>(ii) Compete for work for the Commission based on the information for a period of six months after either the completion of this contract or the release of the information to the public, whichever is first;</p>

<p>(iii) Submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government based on the information until one year after the release of the information to the public; or</p>

<p>(iv) Release the information without prior written approval by the contracting officer unless the information has previously been released to the public by the NRC.</p>

<p>(2) In addition, the contractor agrees that, to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information under this contract, the contractor shall treat the information in accordance with restrictions placed on use of the information.</p>

<p>(3) Subject to patent and security provisions of this contract, the contractor shall have the right to use technical data it produces under this contract for private purposes provided that all requirements of this contract have been met.</p>

<p>(f) Subcontracts. Except as provided in 48 CFR 2009.570-2, the contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph, in subcontracts of any tier. The terms contract, contractor, and contracting officer, must be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>

<p>(g) Remedies. For breach of any of the above restrictions, or for intentional nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant interest required to be disclosed concerning this contract or for such erroneous representations that necessarily imply bad faith, the Government may terminate the contract for default, disqualify the contractor from subsequent contractual efforts, and pursue other remedies permitted by law or this contract.</p>

<p>(h) Waiver. A request for waiver under this clause must be directed in writing to the contracting officer in accordance with the procedures outlined in 48 CFR 2009.570-9.</p>

<p>(i) Follow-on effort. The contractor shall be ineligible to participate in NRC contracts, subcontracts, or proposals therefor (solicited or unsolicited) which stem directly from the contractor's performance of work under this contract. Furthermore, unless so directed in writing by the contracting officer, the contractor may not perform any technical consulting or management support services work or evaluation activities under this contract on any of its products or services or the products or services of another firm if the contractor has been substantially involved in the development or marketing of the products or services.</p>

<p>(1) If the contractor under this contract, prepares a complete or essentially complete statement of work or specifications, the contractor is not eligible to perform or participate in the initial contractual effort which is based on the statement of work or specifications. The contractor may not incorporate its products or services in the statement of work or specifications unless so directed in writing by the contracting officer, in which case the restrictions in this paragraph do not apply.</p>

<p>(2) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the contractor from offering or selling its standard commercial items to the Government. </p>

<p>(b) Bidders shall insert a definite price or indicate "no charge" in the blank space provided for each item and/or sub-item listed in Section B.

<p>(d) Separation charges, in any form, are not solicited. Bids containing charges for discontinuance, termination, failure to exercise an option, or for any other purpose will cause the bid to be rejected as nonresponsive.</p>

<p>(e) A preaward on-site survey of the bidder's facilities, equipment, etc., in accordance with FAR 9.105 and 9.106, may be made by representatives of the Commission for the purpose of determining whether the bidder is responsible within the meaning of FAR 9.1, and whether the bidder possesses qualifications that are conducive to the production of work that will meet the requirements, specifications, and provisions of this contract.

<p align="center">Contract Award and Evaluation of Proposals (Oct 1999)</p>

<p>(a) By use of narrative and numerical (as appropriate) scoring techniques, proposals are evaluated against the evaluation factors specified in paragraph * below. These factors are listed in their relative order of importance. </p>

<p>(b) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value, as defined in FAR 2.101, after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. </p>

<p>(c) The Government may:</p>

<p>(1) Reject any or all proposals if the action is in the Government's interest.</p>

<p>(2) Waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.</p>

<p>(d) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. The Government reserves the right to seek proposal clarifications (e.g., capability issues as described in FAR 15.306(a) or minor or clerical errors as described in FAR 14.407); and hold communications as described in FAR 15.306(b)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>

<p>(e) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.</p>

<p>(f) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so.</p>

<p>(g) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.</p>

<p>(h) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>

<p>(i) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.</p>

<p>(j) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.</p>

<p>(k) A separate cost analysis is performed on each cost proposal. To provide a common base for evaluation of cost proposals, the level of effort data must be expressed in staff hours. Where a Contractor Spending Plan (CSP) is required by other provisions of this solicitation, consideration is given to the Plan for completeness, reasonableness, and as a measure of effective management of the effort.</p>

<p>(a) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) policy is to support the contractor's expression of professional health and safety related concerns associated with the contractor's work for NRC that may differ from a prevailing NRC staff view, disagree with an NRC decision or policy position, or take issue with proposed or established agency practices. An occasion may arise when an NRC contractor, contractor's personnel, or subcontractor personnel believes that a conscientious expression of a competent judgement is required to document such concerns on matters directly associated with its performance of the contract. The NRC's policy is to support these instances as Differing Professional Views (DPVs).</p>

This procedure may be found in Attachments to this document. The contractor shall provide a copy of the NRC DPV procedure to all of its employees performing under this contract and to all subcontractors who shall, in turn, provide a copy of the procedure to its employees.

<p>Procedures for Resolving NRC Contractor Differing Professional Views (DPVs) (Oct 1999)</p>

<p>(a) The following procedure provides for the expression and resolution of differing professional views (DPVs) of health and safety related concerns of NRC contractors and contractor personnel on matters connected to the subject of the contract. Subcontractor DPVs must be submitted through the prime contractor. The prime contractor or subcontractor shall submit all DPV's received but need not endorse them.</p>

<p>(b) The NRC may authorize up to eight reimbursable hours for the contractor to document, in writing, a DPV by the contractor, the contractor's personnel, or subcontractor personnel. The contractor shall not be entitled to any compensation for effort on a DPV which exceeds the specified eight hour limit. </p>

<p>(c) Before incurring costs to document a DPV, the contractor shall first determine whether there are sufficient funds obligated under the contract which are available to cover the costs of writing a DPV. If there are insufficient obligated funds under the contract, the contractor shall first request the NRC contracting officer for additional funding to cover the costs of preparing the DPV and authorization to proceed.</p>

<p>(d) Contract funds shall not be authorized to document an allegation where the use of this NRC contractor DPV process is inappropriate. Examples of such instances are: allegations of wrongdoing which should be addressed directly to the NRC Office of the Inspector General (OIG), issues submitted anonymously, or issues raised which have already been considered, addressed, or rejected, absent significant new information. This procedure does not provide anonymity. Individuals desiring anonymity should contact the NRC OIG or submit the information under NRC's Allegation Program, as appropriate.</p>

<p>(e) When required, the contractor shall initiate the DPV process by submitting a written statement directly to the NRC Office Director or Regional Administrator responsible for the contract, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, Division of Contracts and Property Management, Office of Administration. Each DPV submitted will be evaluated on its own merits.</p>

<p>(f) The DPV, while being brief, must contain the following as it relates to the subject matter of the contract:</p>

<p>(1) A summary of the prevailing NRC view, existing NRC decision or stated position, or the proposed or established NRC practice.</p>

<p>(2) A description of the submitter's views and how they differ from any of the above items.</p>

<p>(3) The rationale for the submitter's views, including an assessment based on risk, safety and cost benefit considerations of the consequences should the submitter's position not be adopted by NRC.</p>

<p>(g) The Office Director or Regional Administrator will immediately forward the submittal to the NRC DPV Review Panel and acknowledge receipt of the DPV, ordinarily within five (5) calendar days of receipt.</p>

<p>(h) The panel will normally review the DPV within seven calendar days of receipt to determine whether enough information has been supplied to undertake a detailed review of the issue. Typically, within 30 calendar days of receipt of the necessary information to begin a review, the panel will provide a written report of its findings to the Office Director or Regional Administrator and to the Contracting Officer, which includes a recommended course of action.</p>

<p>(i) The Office Director or Regional Administrator will consider the DPV Review Panel's report, make a decision on the DPV and provide a written decision to the contractor and the Contracting Officer normally within seven calendar days after receipt of the panel's recommendation.</p>

<p>(j) Subsequent to the decision made regarding the DPV Review Panel's report, a summary of the issue and its disposition will be included in the NRC Weekly Information Report submitted by the Office Director. The DPV file will be retained in the Office or Region for a minimum of one year thereafter. For purposes of the contract, the DPV shall be considered a deliverable under the contract. Based upon the Office Director or Regional Administrator's report, the matter will be closed.</p>
