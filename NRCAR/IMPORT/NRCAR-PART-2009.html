      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) It is NRC policy that only competitively awarded contracts shall be placed with an individual who was employed by the NRC within two years from the date of the Request for Procurement Action. This policy also applies to:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The noncompetitive award of contracts to organizations where former NRC employees have dominant ownership interests in the organization, such as partners or majority stockholders;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The noncompetitive award of contracts to organizations where former NRC employees have dominant management interests, such as principal officers, or where the organization is predominantly staffed by former NRC employees; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The noncompetitive award of contracts, task orders or other NRC work assignments where the particular assignment is to be performed by designated former NRC employees, including principal investigators, key personnel, and others who will perform more than a nominal amount of the work in question.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The following procurement actions are considered noncompetitive for the purposes of this policy:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Contracts awarded noncompetitively under the Small Business Administration's 8(a) Program;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Individual task orders if the former employee was not identified as “key personnel” in a proposal which was evaluated under competitive procedures;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Unsolicited proposals;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Subcontracts that require review for the purpose of granting consent under NRC prime contracts.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The term <em class="ph i">NRC employee</em> includes special Government employees performing services for NRC as experts, advisors, consultants, or members of advisory committees, if - 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The contract arises directly out of the individual's activity as a special employee;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The individual is in a position to influence the award of the contract; or
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The Contracting Officer determines that another conflict of interest exists.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) A justification explaining why it is in the best interest of the Government to contract with an individual or firm described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section on a noncompetitive basis may be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive after consulting with the Executive Director for Operations. This is in addition to any justification and approvals which may be required by the FAR for use of other than full and open competition.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Nothing in this policy statement relieves former employees from obligations prescribed by law, such as 18 U.S.C. 207, Restrictions on Former Officers, Employees, and Elected Officials of the Executive and Legislative Branches.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) It is the policy of NRC to avoid, eliminate, or neutralize contractor organizational conflicts of interest. The NRC achieves this objective by requiring all prospective contractors to submit information describing relationships, if any, with organizations or persons (including those regulated by the NRC) which may give rise to actual or potential conflicts of interest in the event of contract award.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Contractor conflict of interest determinations cannot be made automatically or routinely. The application of sound judgment on virtually a case-by-case basis is necessary if the policy is to be applied to satisfy the overall public interest. It is not possible to prescribe in advance a specific method or set of criteria which would serve to identify and resolve all of the contractor conflict of interest situations that might arise. However, examples are provided in the regulations in this chapter to guide application of this policy guidance. The ultimate test is as follows: Might the contractor, if awarded the contract, be placed in a position where its judgment may be biased, or where it may have an unfair competitive advantage?
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The conflict of interest rule contained in this subpart applies to contractors and offerors only. Individuals or firms who have other relationships with the NRC (e.g., parties to a licensing proceeding) are not covered by the regulations in this chapter. This rule does not apply to the acquisition of consulting services through the personnel appointment process. NRC agreements with other Govern ment agencies, international organizations, or state, local, or foreign Governments. Separate procedures for avoiding conflicts of interest will be employed in these agreements, as appropriate.

         <span class="ph autonumber">2009.570-3</span> Criteria for recognizing contractor organizational conflicts of interest.</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p Runin List1">(a) <em class="ph i">General.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Two questions will be asked in determining whether actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Are there conflicting roles which might bias an offeror's or contractor's judgment in relation to its work for the NRC?
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) May the offeror or contractor be given an unfair competitive advantage based on the performance of the contract?
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) NRC's ultimate determination that organizational conflicts of interest exist will be made in light of common sense and good business judgment based upon the relevant facts. While it is difficult to identify and to prescribe in advance a specific method for avoiding all of the various situations or relationships that might involve potential organizational conflicts of interest, NRC personnel will pay particular attention to proposed contractual requirements that call for the rendering of advice, consultation or evaluation activities, or similar activities that directly lay the groundwork for the NRC's decisions on regulatory activities, future procurements, and research programs. Any work performed at an applicant or licensee site will also be closely scrutinized by the NRC staff.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Situations or relationships.</em> The following situations or relationships may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The offeror or contractor shall disclose information that may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest under the following circumstances. The information may include the scope of work or specification for the requirement being performed, the period of performance, and the name and telephone number for a point of contact at the organization knowledgeable about the commercial contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice and recommendations to the NRC in the same technical area where it is also providing consulting assistance to any organization regulated by the NRC.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice to the NRC on the same or similar matter on which it is also providing assistance to any organization regulated by the NRC.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Where the offeror or contractor evaluates its own products or services, or has been substantially involved in the development or marketing of the products or services of another entity.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Where the award of a contract would result in placing the offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be biased in relation to its work for the NRC, or would result in an unfair competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) Where the offeror or contractor solicits or performs work at an applicant or licensee site while performing work in the same technical area for the NRC at the same site.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The contracting officer may request specific information from an offeror or contractor or may require special contract clauses such as provided in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="[rp:link:nrcar-part-2009]#Section_2009_570_5_T48_606327317">2009.570-5</a>(b) in the following circumstances:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Where the offeror or contractor prepares specifications that are to be used in competitive procurements of products or services covered by the specifications.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Where the offeror or contractor prepares plans for specific approaches or methodologies that are to be incorporated into competitive procurements using the approaches or methodologies.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to information not available to the public concerning NRC plans, policies, or programs that could form the basis for a later procurement action.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to proprietary information of its competitors.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) Where the award of a contract might result in placing the offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be biased in relation to its work for the NRC or might result in an unfair competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Policy application guidance.</em> The following examples are illustrative only and are not intended to identify and resolve all contractor organizational conflict of interest situations.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(1)
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			<em class="ph i">Example.</em> The ABC Corp., in response to a Request For Proposal (RFP), proposes to undertake certain analyses of a reactor component as called for in the RFP. The ABC Corp. is one of several companies considered to be technically well qualified. In response to the inquiry in the RFP, the ABC Corp. advises that it is currently performing similar analyses for the reactor manufacturer.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Guidance.</em> An NRC contract for that particular work normally would not be awarded to the ABC Corp. because the company would be placed in a position in which its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for the NRC. Because there are other well-qualified companies available, there would be no reason for considering a waiver of the policy.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(2)
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			<em class="ph i">Example.</em> The ABC Corp., in response to an RFP, proposes to perform certain analyses of a reactor component that is unique to one type of advanced reactor. As is the case with other technically qualified companies responding to the RFP, the ABC Corp. is performing various projects for several different utility clients. None of the ABC Corp. projects have any relationship to the work called for in the RFP. Based on the NRC evaluation, the ABC Corp. is considered to be the best qualified company to perform the work outlined in the RFP.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Guidance.</em> An NRC contract normally could be awarded to the ABC Corp. because no conflict of interest exists which could motivate bias with respect to the work. An appropriate clause would be included in the contract to preclude the ABC Corp. from subsequently contracting for work with the private sector that could create a conflict during the performance of the NRC contract. For example, ABC Corp. would be precluded from the performance of similar work for the company developing the advanced reactor mentioned in the example.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(3)
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			<em class="ph i">Example.</em> The ABC Corp., in response to a competitive RFP, submits a proposal to assist the NRC in revising NRC's guidance documents on the respiratory protection requirements of 10 CFR part 20. ABC Corp. is the only firm determined to be technically acceptable. ABC Corp. has performed substantial work for regulated utilities in the past and is expected to continue similar efforts in the future. The work has and will cover the writing, implementation, and administration of compliance respiratory protection programs for nuclear power plants.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Guidance.</em> This situation would place the firm in a role where its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for the NRC. Because the nature of the required work is vitally important in terms of the NRC's responsibilities and no reasonable alternative exists, a waiver of the policy, in accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="[rp:link:nrcar-part-2009]#Section_2009_570_9_T48_6063273111">2009.570-9</a> may be warranted. Any waiver must be fully documented in accordance with the waiver provisions of this policy with particular attention to the establishment of protective mechanisms to guard against bias.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(4)
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			<em class="ph i">Example.</em> The ABC Corp. submits a proposal for a new system to evaluate a specific reactor component's performance for the purpose of developing standards that are important to the NRC program. The ABC Corp. has advised the NRC that it intends to sell the new system to industry once its practicability has been demonstrated. Other companies in this business are using older systems for evaluation of the specific reactor component.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Guidance.</em> A contract could be awarded to the ABC Corp. if the contract stipulates that no information produced under the contract will be used in the contractor's private activities unless this information has been reported to the NRC. Data on how the reactor component performs, which is reported to the NRC by contractors, will normally be disseminated by the NRC to others to preclude an unfair competitive advantage. When the NRC furnishes information about the reactor component to the contractor for the performance of contracted work, the information may not be used in the contractor's private activities unless the information is generally available to others. Further, the contract will stipulate that the contractor will inform the NRC contracting officer of all situations in which the information, developed about the performance of the reactor component under the contract, is proposed to be used.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(5)
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			<em class="ph i">Example.</em> The ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, proposes to assemble a map showing certain seismological features of the Appalachian fold belt.

         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			<em class="ph i">Example.</em> AD Division of ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, submits a proposal to assist the NRC in the safety and environmental review of applications for licenses for the construction, operation, and decommissioning of fuel cycle facilities. ABC Corp. is divided into two separate and distinct divisions, AD and BC. The BC Division performs the same or similar services for industry. The BC Division is currently providing the same or similar services required under the NRC's contract for an applicant or licensee.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Guidance.</em> An NRC contract for that particular work would not be awarded to the ABC Corp. The AD Division could be placed in a position to pass judgment on work performed by the BC Division, which could bias its work for NRC. Further, the Conflict of Interest provisions apply to ABC Corp. and not to separate or distinct divisions within the company. If no reasonable alternative exists, a waiver of the policy could be sought in accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="[rp:link:nrcar-part-2009]#Section_2009_570_9_T48_6063273111">2009.570-9</a>.</p>

The contract is for two years with an estimated value of $5 million. Near the completion of the NRC work, ABC Corp. requests authority to solicit for a $100K contract with the same utility to transport spent fuel to a disposal site. ABC Corp. is performing no other work for the utility.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Guidance.</em> The Contracting Officer would allow the contractor to proceed with the solicitation because it is not in the same technical area as the NRC work; and the potential for technical bias by the contractor because of financial ties to the utility is slight due to the relative value of the two contracts.

         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Guidance.</em> An NRC contract would not normally be awarded to ABC Corp. because these factors create the potential for financial loyalty to the utility that may bias the technical judgment of the contractor.

			The fact that the NRC can identify and later avoid, eliminate, or neutralize any potential organizational conflicts arising from the performance of a contract is not relevant to a determination of the existence of conflicts prior to the award of a contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) It is not relevant that the contractor has the professional reputation of being able to resist temptations which arise from organizational conflicts of interest, or that a follow-on procurement is not involved, or that a contract is awarded on a competitive or a sole source basis.

         <p class="p List1">(a) The following procedures are designed to assist the NRC contracting officer in determining whether situations or relationships exist which may constitute organizational conflicts of interest with respect to a particular offeror or contractor. The procedures apply to small purchases meeting the criteria stated in the following paragraph (b) of this section.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The organizational conflicts of interest representation provision at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="[rp:link:nrcar-part-2052]#Section_2052_209_71_T48_6063825115">2052.209-71</a> must be included in solicitations and contracts resulting from unsolicited proposals. The contracting officer must also include this provision for task orders and contract modifications for new work for:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Evaluation services or activities;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Technical consulting and management support services;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Research; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Other contractual situations where special organizational conflicts of interest provisions are noted in the solicitation and would be included in the resulting contract. This representation requirement also applies to all modifications for additional effort under the contract except those issued under the “Changes” clause. Where, however, a statement of the type required by the organizational conflicts of interest representation provisions has previously been submitted with regard to the contract being modified, only an updating of the statement is required.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The offeror may, because of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, propose to exclude specific kinds of work contained in a RFP unless the RFP specifically prohibits the exclusion. Any such proposed exclusion by an offeror will be considered by the NRC in the evaluation of proposals. If the NRC considers the proposed excluded work to be an essential or integral part of the required work and its exclusion would be to the detriment of the competitive posture of the other offerors, the NRC shall reject the proposal as unacceptable.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) The offeror's failure to execute the representation required by paragraph (b) of this section with respect to an invitation for bids is considered to be a minor informality. The offeror will be permitted to correct the omission.
