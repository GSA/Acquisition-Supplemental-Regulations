In this clause, the term “potential conflict” means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest.

These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the Federal government.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) The initial [insert initial contract term] contract term or ordering period may be extended or reduced on the basis of contractor performance, resulting in a contract term or an ordering period lasting at least [insert minimum contract term] years from the date of contract award, to a maximum of [insert maximum contract term] years after the date of contract award.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(b) The contractor's performance will be measured against stated standards by the performance monitors, who will report their findings to the Award Term Determining Official (or Board).

                                    <p class="p List1">(d) The contractor will submit a brief written self-evaluation of its performance within X days after the end of the evaluation period. The self-evaluation report shall not exceed seven pages, and it may be considered in the Award Term Review Board's (ATRB's) (or Term Determining Official's) evaluation of the contractor's performance during this period.

</p>
                                    <p class="p HD1">Notice About Research Activities Involving Human Subjects (MAR 2011)
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Applicable Regulations.</em> In accordance with Department of Education regulations on the protection of human subjects, title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, part 97 (“the regulations”), the contractor, any subcontractors, and any other entities engaged in covered (nonexempt) research activities are required to establish and maintain procedures for the protection of human subjects.
</p>
                                    <p class="p Runin List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Definitions.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The regulations define <em class="ph i">research</em> as “a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” (34 CFR 97.102(d)). If an activity follows a deliberate plan designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge, it is research. Research includes activities that meet this definition, whether or not they are conducted under a program considered research for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may include research activities.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) The regulations define a <em class="ph i">human subject</em> as a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or obtains identifiable private information. (34 CFR 97.102(f)). The definition of a human subject is met if an activity involves obtaining - 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) Information about a living person by - 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List4">(A) Manipulating that person's environment, as might occur when a new instructional technique is tested; or
</p>
                                    <p class="p List4">(B) Communicating or interacting with the individual, as occurs with surveys and interviews; or
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) Private information about a living person in such a way that the information can be linked to that individual (the identity of the subject is or may be readily determined by the investigator or associated with the information). Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and that an individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a school health record).
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Exemptions.</em> The regulations provide exemptions from coverage for activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories set forth in 34 CFR 97.101(b)(1)-(6). However, if the research subjects are children, the exemption at 34 CFR 97.101(b)(2) (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> research involving the use of educational tests, survey procedures, interview procedures or observation of public behavior) is modified by 34 CFR 97.401(b), as explained in paragraph (d) of this provision. Research studies that are conducted under a Federal statute that requires without exception that the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information will be maintained throughout the research and thereafter, <em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> the Institute of Education Sciences confidentiality statute, 20 U.S.C. 9573, are exempt under 34 CFR 97.101(b)(3)(ii).
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Children as research subjects.</em> Paragraph (a) of 34 CFR 97.402 of the regulations defines <em class="ph i">children</em> as “persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted.” Paragraph (b) of 34 CFR 97.401 of the regulations provides that, if the research involves children as subjects - 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) The exemption in 34 CFR 97.101(b)(2) does not apply to activities involving - 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) Survey or interview procedures involving children as subjects; or

                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) Observations of public behavior of children in which the investigator or investigators will participate in the activities being observed.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) The exemption in 34 CFR 97.101(b)(2) continues to apply, unmodified by 34 CFR 97.401(b), to - 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) Educational tests; and
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) Observations of public behavior in which the investigator or investigators will not participate in the activities being observed.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Proposal Instructions.</em> An offeror proposing to do research that involves human subjects must provide information to the Department on the proposed exempt and nonexempt research activities. The offeror should submit this information as an attachment to its technical proposal. No specific page limitation applies to this requirement, but the offeror should be brief and to the point.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) For exempt research activities involving human subjects, the offeror should identify the exemption(s) that applies and provide sufficient information to allow the Department to determine that the designated exemption(s) is appropriate. Normally, the narrative on the exemption(s) can be provided in one paragraph.
</p>

Identify the criteria for inclusion or exclusion of any subpopulation. Explain the rationale for the involvement of special classes of subjects, such as children, children with disabilities, adults with disabilities, persons with mental disabilities, pregnant women, institutionalized individuals, or others who are likely to be vulnerable.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Sources of materials:</em> Identify the sources of research material obtained from or about individually identifiable living human subjects in the form of specimens, records, or data.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(vii) <em class="ph i">Collaborating sites:</em> If research involving human subjects will take place at collaborating site(s), name the sites and briefly describe their involvement or role in the research.

</p>
                                    <p class="p HD1">Research Activities Involving Human Subjects (MAR 2011)
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) In accordance with Department of Education regulations on the protection of human subjects in research, title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, part 97 (“the regulations”), the contractor, any subcontractors, and any other entities engaged in covered (nonexempt) research activities are required to establish and maintain procedures for the protection of human subjects. The definitions in 34 CFR 97.102 apply to this clause. As used in this clause, <em class="ph i">covered research</em> means research involving human subjects that is not exempt under 34 CFR 97.101(b) and 97.401(b).
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(b) If ED determines that proposed research activities involving human subjects are covered (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> not exempt under the regulations), the contracting officer or contacting officer's designee will require the contractor to apply for the Federal Wide Assurance from the Office for Human Research Protections, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, if the contractor does not already have one on file. The contracting officer will also require that the contractor obtain and send to the Department documentation of Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approval of the research.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(c) In accordance with 34 CFR part 97, all subcontractors and any legally separate entity (neither owned nor operated by the contractor) that will be engaged in covered research activities under or related to this contract shall be required to comply with the requirements for assurances and IRB approvals. The contractor must include the substance of this clause, including paragraph (c) of this clause, in all subcontracts, and must notify any other entities engaged in the covered research activities of their responsibility to comply with the regulations.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(d) Under no condition shall the contractor conduct, or allow to be conducted, any covered research activity involving human subjects prior to the Department's receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. (34 CFR 97.103(f).) No covered research involving human subjects shall be initiated under this contract until the contractor has provided the contracting officer (or the contracting officer's designee) a properly completed certification form certifying IRB review and approval of the research activity, and the contracting officer or designee has received the certification. This restriction applies to the activities of each participating entity.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(e) In accordance with 34 CFR 97.109(e), an IRB must conduct continuing reviews of covered research activities at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once a year. Covered research activities that are expected to last one year or more are therefore subject to review by an IRB at least once a year.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) For each covered activity under this contract that requires continuing review, the contractor shall submit an annual written representation to the contracting officer (or the contracting officer's designee) stating whether covered research activities have been reviewed and approved by an IRB within the previous 12 months. The contractor may use the form titled “Protection of Human Subjects: Assurance Identification/Certification/Declaration of Exemption” for this representation. For multi-institutional projects, the contractor shall provide this information on its behalf and on behalf of any other entity engaged in covered research activities for which continuing IRB reviews are required.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) If the IRB disapproves, suspends, terminates, or requires modification of any covered research activities under this contract, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer in writing of the IRB's action.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(f) The contractor shall bear full responsibility for performing as safely as is feasible all activities under this contract involving the use of human subjects and for complying with all applicable regulations and requirements concerning human subjects. No one (neither the contractor, nor any subcontractor, agent, or employee of the contractor, nor any other person or organization, institution, or group of any kind whatsoever) involved in the performance of such activities shall be deemed to constitute an agent or employee of the Department of Education or of the Federal government with respect to such activities. The contractor agrees to discharge its obligations, duties, and undertakings and the work pursuant thereto, whether requiring professional judgment or otherwise, as an independent contractor without imputing liability on the part of the Government for the acts of the contractor and its employees.
