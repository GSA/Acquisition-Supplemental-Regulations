         <p outputclass="List1">(c) FSA - Notwithstanding other provisions of the FAR, a bid or proposal due date of less than 30 days is permitted after issuance of a synopsis for acquisitions for noncommercial items. However, if time permits, a bid or proposal due date that affords potential offerors reasonable time to respond and fosters quality submissions should be established.
