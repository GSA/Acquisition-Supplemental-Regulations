			<p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(1)  Contracting officers shall use objective criteria to the maximum extent possible to measure contract performance.  Objective criteria are associated with cost-plus-incentive-fee and fixed-price-incentive contracts.</p>
			<p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2)  When objective criteria exist but the contracting officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government also to incentivize subjective elements of performance, the most appropriate contract type is a multiple-incentive contract containing both objective incentives and subjective award-fee criteria (i.e., cost-plus-incentive-fee/award-fee or fixed-price-incentive/award-fee).</p>
