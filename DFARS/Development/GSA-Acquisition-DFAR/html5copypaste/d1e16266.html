The definition of Caribbean Basin country end products in FAR 25.003 excludes those end products that are not eligible for duty-free treatment under 19 U.S.C. 2703(b).  Therefore certain watches, watch parts, and luggage from certain Caribbean Basin countries are not eligible products.  However, 225.003 expands the definition of Caribbean Basin country end products to include petroleum and any product derived from petroleum, in accordance with Section 8094 of Pub. L. 103-139.    </p>

			<p class="p List4">(A)  Specialty metal mill products, such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, and sheet, that have not been incorporated into end items, subsystems, assemblies, or components.

			<p class="p List4">(B)  Written documentation by the requiring activity, with specificity, why such alternatives are unacceptable.</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  A domestic nonavailability determination that applies to more than one contract (i.e., a class domestic nonavailability determination), requires the approval of the USD(AT&amp;L).</p>
			<p class="p List4">(A)  At least 30 days before making a domestic nonavailability determination that would apply to more than one contract, the USD(AT&amp;L) will, to the maximum extent practicable, and in a manner consistent with the protection of national security and confidential business information—</p>
			<p class="p List2">(<em class="ph i">1</em>)  Publish a notice on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.FedBizOpps.gov or any successor site) of the intent to make the domestic nonavailability determination; and</p>

			<p class="p List4">(B)  The USD(AT&amp;L)—</p>

			<p class="p List2">(6)  End items containing a minimal amount of otherwise noncompliant specialty metals (i.e., specialty metals not melted or produced in the United States that are not covered by another exception listed in this paragraph (b)), if the total weight of noncompliant specialty metal does not exceed 2 percent of the total weight of all specialty metal in the end item.  This exception does not apply to high performance magnets containing specialty metals.  See PGI 225.7003-3(b)(6) for a table of applicability of specialty metals restrictions to magnets.</p>
			<p class="p List1">(c)  <em class="ph i">Compliance for</em> c<em class="ph i">ommercial derivative military articles.</em>  The restrictions at 225.7003-2(a) do not apply to an item acquired under a prime contract if—</p>

			<p class="p List2">(2)  The USD(AT&amp;L), or the Secretary of the military department concerned, determines that the item is a commercial derivative military article (defense agencies see procedures at PGI 225.7003-3(c)).  The contracting officer shall submit the offeror’s certification and a request for a determination to the appropriate official, through agency channels, and shall notify the offeror when a decision has been made.</p>
			<p class="p List1">(d)  <em class="ph i">National security waiver.  </em>The USD(AT&amp;L) may waive the restrictions at 225.7003-2 if the USD(AT&amp;L) determines in writing that acceptance of the item is necessary to the national security interests of the United States (see procedures at PGI 225.7003-3(d)).  This authority may not be delegated. </p>
			<p class="p List2">(1)  The written determination of the USD(AT&amp;L)—</p>
			<p class="p List3">(i)  Shall specify the quantity of end items to which the national security waiver applies;</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  Shall specify the time period over which the national security waiver applies; and</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iii)  Shall be provided to the congressional defense committees before the determination is executed, except that in the case of an urgent national security requirement, the determination may be provided to the congressional defense committees up to 7 days after it is executed.</p>
			<p class="p List2">(2)  After making such a determination, the USD(AT&amp;L) will—</p>
			<p class="p List3">(i)  Ensure that the contractor or subcontractor responsible for the noncompliant specialty metal develops and implements an effective plan to ensure future compliance; and</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  Determine whether or not the noncompliance was knowing and willful.  If the USD(AT&amp;L) determines that the noncompliance was knowing and willful, the appropriate debarring and suspending official shall consider suspending or debarring the contractor or subcontractor until such time as the contractor or subcontractor has effectively addressed the issues that led to the noncompliance.</p>
			<p class="p List2">(3)  Because national security waivers will only be granted when the acquisition in question is necessary to the national security interests of the United States, the requirement for a plan will be applied as a condition subsequent, and not a condition precedent, to the granting of a waiver.</p>

			<p class="p List1">(a)  When specifically authorized by reference elsewhere in this subpart, the restrictions on certain foreign purchases under 10 U.S.C. 2534(a) may be waived as follows:</p>
			<p class="p List2">(1)(i)  The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (USD(AT&amp;L)), without power of delegation, may waive a restriction for a particular item for a particular foreign country upon determination that¾</p>
			<p class="p List4">(A)  United States producers of the item would not be jeopardized by competition from a foreign country, and that country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense items produced in that country; or</p>
			<p class="p List4">(B)  Application of the restriction would impede cooperative programs entered into between DoD and a foreign country, or would impede the reciprocal procurement of defense items under a memorandum of understanding providing for reciprocal procurement of defense items under 225.872, and that country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense items produced in that country.</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  A notice of the determination to exercise the waiver authority shall be published in the Federal Register and submitted to the congressional defense committees at least 15 days before the effective date of the waiver.</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iii)  The effective period of the waiver shall not exceed 1 year.</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iv)  For contracts entered into prior to the effective date of a waiver, provided adequate consideration is received to modify the contract, the waiver shall be applied as directed or authorized in the waiver to¾</p>

			<p class="p List4">(B)  Options for the procurement of items that are exercised after the effective date of the waiver, if the option prices are adjusted for any reason other than the application of the waiver.</p>
			<p class="p List2">(2)  The head of the contracting activity may waive a restriction on a case-by-case basis upon execution of a determination and findings that any of the following applies:</p>
			<p class="p List3">(i)  The restriction would cause unreasonable delays.</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  Satisfactory quality items manufactured in the United States or Canada are not available.</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iii)  Application of the restriction would result in the existence of only one source for the item in the United States or Canada.</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iv)  Application of the restriction is not in the national security interests of the United States.</p>
			<p class="p List3">(v)  Application of the restriction would adversely affect a U.S. company.</p>
			<p class="p List2">(3)  A restriction is waived when it would cause unreasonable costs.  The cost of an item of U.S. or Canadian origin is unreasonable if it exceeds 150 percent of the offered price, inclusive of duty, of items that are not of U.S. or Canadian origin.</p>

		<div class="body conbody">
			<p class="p List1">(a)  In pricing FMS contracts where non-U.S. Government prices as described in 225.7303-1 do not exist, except as provided in 225.7303-5, recognize the reasonable and allocable costs of doing business with a foreign government or international organization, even though such costs might not be recognized in the same amounts in pricing other defense contracts.  Examples of such costs include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
			<p class="p List2">(1)  Selling expenses (not otherwise limited by FAR Part 31), such as—</p>
			<p class="p List3">(i)  Maintaining international sales and service organizations;</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  Sales commissions and fees in accordance with FAR Subpart 3.4;</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iii)  Sales promotions, demonstrations, and related travel for sales to foreign governments.  Section 126.8 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations  (22 CFR 126.8) may require Government approval for these costs to be allowable, in which case the appropriate Government approval shall be obtained; and</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iv)  Configuration studies and related technical services undertaken as a direct selling effort to a foreign country.</p>
			<p class="p List2">(2)  Product support and post-delivery service expenses, such as—</p>
			<p class="p List3">(i)  Operations or maintenance training, training or tactics films, manuals, or other related data; and</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  Technical field services provided in a foreign country related to accident investigations, weapon system problems, or operations/tactics enhancement, and related travel to foreign countries.</p>
			<p class="p List2">(3)  <em class="ph i">Offsets</em>.  For additional information see 225.7306.</p>
			<p class="p List3">(i)  An offset agreement is the contractual arrangement between the FMS customer and the U.S. defense contractor that identifies the offset obligation imposed by the FMS customer that has been accepted by the U.S. defense contractor as a condition of the FMS customer’s purchase.  These agreements are distinct and independent of the LOA and the FMS contract.  Further information about offsets and LOAs may be found in the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Security Assistance Management Manual (DSCA 5105.38-M), chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.9. (http://samm.dsca.mil/chapter/chapter-6).</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  A U.S. defense contractor may recover all costs incurred for offset agreements with a foreign government or international organization if the LOA is financed wholly with foreign government or international organization customer cash or repayable foreign military finance credits.</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iii)  The U.S. Government assumes no obligation to satisfy or administer the offset agreement or to bear any of the associated costs.</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iv)  Indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable for purposes of FAR parts 15 and 31 with no further analysis necessary on the part of the contracting officer, provided that the U.S. defense contractor submits to the contracting officer a signed offset agreement or other documentation showing that the FMS customer has made the provision of an indirect offset a condition of the FMS acquisition.  FMS customers are placed on notice through the LOA that indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable without any further analysis by the contracting officer.</p>
			<p class="p List2">(4)  Costs that are the subject of advance agreement under the appropriate provisions of FAR Part 31; or where the advance understanding places a limit on the amounts of cost that will be recognized as allowable in defense contract pricing, and the agreement contemplated that it will apply only to DoD contracts for the U.S. Government's own requirements (as distinguished from contracts for FMS).</p>
			<p class="p List1">(b)  Costs not allowable under FAR Part 31 are not allowable in pricing FMS contracts, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this subsection.</p>
			<p class="p List1">(c)  The limitations for major contractors on independent research and development and bid and proposal (IR&amp;D/B&amp;P) costs for projects that are of potential interest to DoD, in 231.205-18(c)(iii), do not apply to FMS contracts, except as provided in 225.7303-5.  The allowability of IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs on contracts for FMS not wholly paid for from funds made available on a nonrepayable basis is limited to the contract’s allocable share of the contractor’s total IR&amp;D/B&amp;P expenditures.  In pricing contracts for such FMS—</p>
			<p class="p List2">(1)  Use the best estimate of reasonable costs in forward pricing; and</p>
			<p class="p List2">(2)  Use actual expenditures, to the extent that they are reasonable, in determining final cost.</p>
			<p class="p List1">(d)  Under paragraph (e)(1)(A) of Section 21 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2761), the United States must charge for administrative services to recover the estimated cost of administration of sales made under the Arms Export Control Act.</p>
			<p class="p List1">(e)  The limitations in 231.205-1 on allowability of costs associated with leasing Government equipment do not apply to FMS contracts.</p>
