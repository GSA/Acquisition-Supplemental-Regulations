			<p class="p List2">(2)  The contracting officer responsible for negotiation of a proposal generated by a purchasing system with an identified deficiency shall evaluate whether the deficiency impacts the negotiations.  If it does not, the contracting officer should proceed with negotiations.  If it does, the contracting officer should consider other alternatives, e.g.—</p>
			<p class="p List3">(i)  Allowing the contractor additional time to correct the purchasing system deficiency and submit a corrected proposal;</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  Considering another type of contract, e.g., a fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract instead of firm-fixed-price;</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iii)  Using additional cost analysis techniques to determine the reasonableness of the cost elements affected by the purchasing system's deficiency;</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iv)  Segregating the questionable areas as a cost-reimbursable line item;</p>
			<p class="p List3">(v)  Reducing the negotiation objective for profit or fee; or</p>
			<p class="p List3">(vi)  Including a contract (reopener) clause that provides for adjustment of the contract amount after award.</p>
			<p class="p List2">(3)  The contracting officer who incorporates a reopener clause into the contract is responsible for negotiating price adjustments required by the clause.  Any reopener clause necessitated by a purchasing system deficiency should—</p>
			<p class="p List3">(i)  Clearly identify the amounts and items that are in question at the time of negotiation;</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  Indicate a specific time or subsequent event by which the contractor will submit a supplemental proposal, including certified cost or pricing data, identifying the cost impact adjustment necessitated by the deficient purchasing system;</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iii)  Provide for the contracting officer to adjust the contract price unilaterally if the contractor fails to submit the supplemental proposal; and</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iv)  Provide that failure of the Government and the contractor to agree to the price adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause.</p>
