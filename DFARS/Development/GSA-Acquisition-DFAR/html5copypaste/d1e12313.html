		<h3 class="title topictitle3" id="ariaid-title5">217.171 MULTIYEAR CONTRACTS FOR SERVICES.</h3>
		<div class="body conbody">
			<p class="p List1">(a)  The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for a period of not more than 5 years for the following types of services (and items of supply relating to such services), even though funds are limited by statute to obligation only during the fiscal year for which they were appropriated (10 U.S.C. 2306c(a)).  Covered services are—</p>
			<p class="p List2">(1)  Operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations;</p>
			<p class="p List2">(2)  Maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other highly complex military equipment;</p>
			<p class="p List2">(3)  Specialized training requiring high quality instructor skills (e.g., training for pilots and aircrew members or foreign language training);</p>
			<p class="p List2">(4)  Base services (e.g., ground maintenance, in-plane refueling, bus transportation, and refuse collection and disposal); and</p>
			<p class="p List2">(5)  Environmental remediation services for—</p>
			<p class="p List3">(i)  An active military installation;</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  A military installation being closed or realigned under a base closure law as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2667(h)(2); or</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iii)  A site formerly used by DoD (10 U.S.C. 2306c(b)).</p>
			<p class="p List1">(b)  The head of the agency must be guided by the following principles when entering into a multiyear contract for services:</p>
			<p class="p List2">(1)  The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance should not exceed the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life of the plant or equipment.  As used in this section, "useful commercial life" means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than the physical life, with due consideration given to such factors as the location, specialized nature, and obsolescence of the facilities.</p>
			<p class="p List2">(2)  Consider the desirability of obtaining an option to extend the term of the contract for a reasonable period not to exceed 3 years at prices that do not include charges for plant, equipment, or other nonrecurring costs already amortized.</p>
			<p class="p List2">(3)  Consider the desirability of reserving the right to take title, under the appropriate circumstances, to the plant or equipment upon payment of theunamortized portion of the cost (10 U.S.C. 2306c(c)).</p>
			<p class="p List1">(c)  Before entering into a multiyear contract for services, the head of the agency must make a written determination that¾</p>
			<p class="p List2">(1)  There will be a continuing requirement for the services consistent with current plans for the proposed contract period;</p>
			<p class="p List2">(2)  Furnishing the services will require¾</p>
			<p class="p List3">(i)  A substantial initial investment in plant or equipment; or</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  The incurrence of substantial contingent liabilities for the assembly, training, or transportation of a specialized work force; and</p>
			<p class="p List2">(3)  Using a multiyear contract will promote the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting economies in operations (10 U.S.C. 2306c(a)).</p>
			<p class="p List1">(d)  The head of an agency may not initiate a multiyear contract for services if the value of the multiyear contract exceeds $678.5 million unless a law specifically provides authority for the contract (10 U.S.C. 2306c(d)(2)).</p>

			<p class="p List1">(c) Multiyear contracts in amounts exceeding $678.5 million must be specifically authorized by law in an act other than an appropriations act (10 U.S.C. </p>
			<p class="p">2306b(i)(1)).</p>
			<p class="p List1">(d)  The head of the agency may not initiate a multiyear procurement contract for any system (or component thereof) if the value of the multiyear contract would exceed $678.5 million unless authority for the contract is specifically provided in an appropriations act (10 U.S.C. 2306b(l)(3)).</p>
			<p class="p List1">(e)  The head of the agency shall not enter into a multiyear contract unless—</p>

			<p class="p List1">(2)  In addition, for contracts equal to or greater than $678.5 million, the head of the contracting activity must determine that the conditions required by paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section will be met by such contract, in accordance with the Secretary’s certification and determination required by paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</p>

Before initiating an advance procurement, the contracting officer must verify that it is consistent with DoD policy (e.g., the full funding policy in Volume 2A, chapter 1, of DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation).</p>
			<p class="p List1">(h)  The head of the agency shall ensure that the following conditions are satisfiedbefore awarding a multiyear contract for a defense acquisition program that has been specifically authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract authority:</p>
			<p class="p List2">(1)  The multiyear exhibits required by DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation, are included in the agency’s budget estimate submission and the President’s budget request.</p>

			<p class="p List3">(i)  The Secretary has determined that each of the requirements in</p>
			<p class="p List2">FAR 17.105-1, paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5), will be met by such contract and has provided the basis for such determination to the congressional defense committees (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(A)).</p>
			<p class="p List3">(ii)  The Secretary’s determination under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section was made after the completion of a cost analysis performed by the Defense Cost and Resource Center of the Department of Defense and such analysis supportsthe findings (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(B)).</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iii)  The system being acquired pursuant to such contract has not been determined to have experienced cost growth in excess of the critical cost growth threshold pursuant to 10 USC 2433(d) within 5 years prior to the date the Secretary anticipates such contract (or a contract for advance procurement entered into consistent with the authorization for such contract) will be awarded (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(C)).</p>
			<p class="p List3">(iv)  A sufficient number of end items of the system being acquired under such contract have been delivered at or within the most current estimates of the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost for such system to determine that current estimates of such unit costs are realistic (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(D)).</p>
			<p class="p List3">(v)  Sufficient funds will be available in the fiscal year in which the contract is to be awarded to perform the contract, and the future-years defense program for such fiscal year will include the funding required to execute the program without cancellation (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(E)).</p>
			<p class="p List3">(vi)  The contract is a fixed price type contract (10 U.S.C.2306b(i)(3)(F)).</p>
			<p class="p List3">(vii)  The proposed multiyear contract provides for production at not less than minimum economic rates, given the existing tooling and facilities (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(G)).  The head of the agency shall submit to OUSD(C)(P/B)information supporting the agency’s determination that this requirement has been met.</p>

			<p class="p List2">(5)  The Secretary may make the certification under paragraph (h)(2) of this section notwithstanding the fact that one or more of the conditions of such certification are not met if the Secretary determines that, due to exceptional circumstances, proceeding with a multiyear contract under this section is in the best interest of the Department of Defense and the Secretary provides the basis forsuch determination with the certification (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(6)).</p>
			<p class="p List2">(6)  The Secretary of Defense may not delegate this authority to make the certification under paragraph (h)(2) of this section or the determination under paragraph (h)(5) of this section to an official below the  level of the Under Secretaryof Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(7)).</p>
			<p class="p List2">(7)  All other requirements of law are met and there are no other statutory restrictions on using a multiyear contract for the specific system or component.  One such restriction may be the achievement of specified cost savings.  If the agency finds, after negotiations with the contractor(s), that the specified savings cannot be achieved, the head of the agency shall assess the savings that, nevertheless, could be achieved by using a multiyear contract.  If the savings are substantial, the head of the agency may request relief from the law’s specific savings requirement (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(4)).  The request shall¾</p>
