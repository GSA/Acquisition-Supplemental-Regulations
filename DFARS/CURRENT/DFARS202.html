 Offset 
means a benefit or obligation agreed to by a contractor and a foreign

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
(1)  A direct offset involves benefits or obligations,
including supplies or services that are directly related to the
item(s) being purchased and are integral to the deliverable of the
FMS contract.  For example, as a condition of a foreign military
sale, the contractor may require or agree to permit the customer to
produce in its country certain components or subsystems of the item
being sold.  Generally, direct offsets must be performed within a
specified period, because they are integral to the deliverable of the
FMS contract.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
(2)  An indirect offset involves benefits or obligations,
including supplies or services that are not directly related to the
specific item(s) being purchased and are not integral to the
deliverable of the FMS contract.  For example, as a condition of a
foreign military sale, the contractor may agree to purchase certain
manufactured products, agricultural commodities, raw materials, or
services, or make an equity investment or grant of equipment required
by the FMS customer, or may agree to build a school, road or other
facility.  Indirect offsets would also include projects that are
related to the FMS contract but not purchased under said contract
(e.g., a project to develop or advance a capability, technology
transfer, or know-how in a foreign company).  Indirect offsets may be
accomplished without a clearly defined period of performance.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><br/>
 Offset
costs  means the costs to the contractor of providing any direct or
indirect offsets required (explicitly or implicitly) as a condition
of a foreign military sale.</p>
