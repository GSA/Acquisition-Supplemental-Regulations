> </span
>As used in this clause, transporter proof of delivery (TPD) means a commercial document that is generated by the Contractor and/or the Contractor’s transporter of supplies and that is signed by the Government customer in order to document delivery of supplies under this contract/order. Examples of TPD are United Parcel Service (UPS) or Federal Express (FEDEX) delivery tracking reports. TPD documentation must include a customer signature, or visibility of the name of the customer who signed.  </p
><p
class="p-Indent1"
lang="en"
>  (b) When this clause is included in the contract or order, the Government may use TPD, in combination with adequate Contractor documentation cross-referencing the TPD to the specific supplies provided, as a basis for accepting the supplies. TPD with adequate supporting documentation satisfies the receipt report requirement and, coupled with acceptance, allows the Government to initiate the payment process, if all other applicable payment conditions are satisfied.  </p
><p
class="p-Indent1"
lang="en"
>  (c) To facilitate the payment process, the Government will initiate a request for the Contractor to provide TPD when the customer has not provided receipt acknowledgement to the buying activity. If TPD is requested and the Contractor agrees to provide it, the documentation must include the customer signature, or visibility of the name of the customer who signed, and as much of the following information as possible: </p

>  (a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</span

The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and legal counsel. Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</span
