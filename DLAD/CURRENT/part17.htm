>  (a) DoD policy requires DoD warranted contracting officer review of all non-Economy Act orders over $500,000. DLA policy requires that a DLA warranted contracting officer review the assisted acquisition from a non-DoD entity of either supplies or services valued over the SAT. This review must be accomplished prior to sending the order to the funds certifier or issuing the military inter-departmental purchase request (MIPR) to the non-DoD activity. If the requesting official is different from the contracting officer, the requesting official must also review the acquisition package to ensure compliance with FAR, and DFARS. Contracting officers must not split requirements into smaller amounts in order to avoid contracting officer review.</p

>“D1-D6 schedule”</span
> means surge requirements expressed in exact quantities with a 6-month sustainable accelerated delivery. The D1-D6 schedule is determined and obtained by using the support planning integrated data enterprise readiness system (SPIDERS) or industrial base management system (IBMS), or consulting the industrial specialist. The D1-D6 schedule is used when the monthly wartime rate (MWR) cannot be applied.  D1-D6 identifies the surge requirement, including the Services’ go-to-war requirements.</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
><span
style="font-style: italic;"
>“Industrial capability issue (ICI)” </span
>means a procurement issue created by the lack of industrial capability, capacity, and/or raw or semi-finished materials with lead-time issues that impact the ability of the supplier to deliver at the wartime rate. Mitigation of the issue requires an investment by the Government to improve capability to deliver at the wartime rate.  These investments are funded through the Warstopper program (refer to DLA Instruction 5025.03, Industrial Capabilities Program – Manage the Warstopper Program).    </p
><p
class="p-Normal"

style="font-style: italic;"
>“Industrial specialist”</span
> means a Government employee within the industrial preparedness branch for DLA Aviation, the industrial support office for DLA Land and Maritime, the industrial base planning office in DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textiles (C&amp;T), the industrial preparedness branch in DLA Troop Support Construction and Equipment (C&amp;E), the strategic material sourcing group<span

><p
class="p-Normal"
><span
style="font-style: italic;"
>“Monthly wartime rate (MWR)”</span
> means the combined recurring requirements for all services after offsets for peacetime DLA direct (DD) procuring organization surge capability or DLA managed war reserve material (WRM) stocks are applied. MWR is a forecast of additional monthly demand during wartime and is expressed in units per month. MWR is used for items with National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and can be found in the industrial base management system (IBMS) or by consulting the supply chain industrial specialist.</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
><span
style="font-style: italic;"
>“Peacetime support issue” </span
>means a situation when DLA is unable to meet the customer’s required delivery date for a weapon system repair part that is coded not mission capable-supply (NMCS), is a critical item that impacts mission capability (MICAP) or prevents the loss of life/property, or cannot be satisfied by routine fulfillment/replenishment procedures.</p

class="p-Normal"
><span
style="font-style: italic;"
>“Surge and sustainment (S&amp;S)” </span
>means increased quantities and accelerated delivery rates required to meet Military Service requisitions across a broad spectrum of contingencies. The increased quantity and accelerated delivery rate are above and beyond the normal peacetime requirements, and are identified as MWR, D1-D6 schedule, or a surge quantity event.</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
><span
style="font-style: italic;"
>“Surge and sustainment coverage” </span
>means a combination of DLA’s ability to fill contingency requisitions through the MWR, D1-D6 schedule, or surge quantity option within the customer’s required delivery date (RDD) and the supplier’s ability to meet surge quantity and sustainable accelerated delivery.</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
><span
style="font-style: italic;"
>“S&amp;S event” </span
>means the relationship between the S&amp;S planning requirement (SSPR), the S&amp;S actual requirements, and S&amp;S coverage. DLA Manual 5025.12, Industrial Capability Program – Surge and Sustainment (S&amp;S), Enclosure 4 provides details on surge and sustainment events (Numbered I through VI). An event may have known surge planning requirements, may be covered for surge, and may be needed in surge quantities during an actual contingency.</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
><span
style="font-style: italic;"
>“Surge and sustainment planning requirements (S&amp;SPR,)”</span
> or “go-to-war requirements,” are forecasted additive monthly wartime demand requirements derived from: (1) annual submissions of Other War Reserve Material Requirements (OWRMR) data from the Military Services; (2) analysis of supply chain risk assessment data and subsequent collaboration with appropriate DLA customers to define/validate additive demand during wartime; and (3) review and analysis of historical data focused on supply items with a weapon system essentiality code (WSEC) of 1, 5, 6 or 7 and Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) project coded requisitions. These requirements are the Services’ go-to-war items for contingency operations, national emergencies, or other readiness needs, when immediate availability of materials and speed of delivery are essential to support national security interests. DoDI 3110.06, War Reserve Materiel Policy, and DLM 4000.25-2, Military Standard Transaction Reporting &amp; Accountability Procedures (MILSTRAP), require identification of these go-to-war requirements to support national security interests of the United States.  <span

>“Surge quantity option”</span
> means an increased quantity above and beyond peacetime demands expressed as a percentage or exact number with a sustainable accelerated delivery. This quantity is other than the MWR or D1-D6 schedule, and used for market ready, commercial, supplier part-numbered items (e.g., cataloged commercial items under a prime supplier arrangement) to support increased demands during contingency operations, national emergencies, or other readiness needs. Surge quantity option is calculated using appropriate demand data through market research, or determined by consulting the industrial specialist.</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
><span
style="font-style: italic;"
>“Unsupported item issue (UII)”</span
> means surge requirements that cannot be met through peacetime inventory, normal peacetime contracting, alternative contract strategies, or a successful resolution using investment to an industrial capability issue (ICI). DLA is required to report a UII to the services for inclusion into their war reserve planning, such as when an investment to resolve an ICI exceeds cost of a Government “buy and hold” solution, or when stocking the item is counter to DoD war reserve policy.</p

>17.9302 Policy.</span
></p
><p
class="p-Normal"
>  (a)  The primary mission of DLA is to support the warfighter in peacetime and wartime, to include smaller contingencies. The ability to surge, or ramp up quickly, and to sustain replenishment of wartime consumable items at an increased pace is critical to the execution of U.S. military strategy. The continuing emphasis by both DLA and suppliers to reduce inventory levels and DLA’s plan to rely on industrial capability directly impacts surge and sustainment coverage. S&amp;S capability is a primary consideration in all acquisition strategies and resource investments.  </p
><p
class="p-Normal"
>  (b) Include surge and sustainment planning requirements (S&amp;SPR) in solicitations for indefinite-delivery term contracts for wartime critical materials. Acquisition planning must identify the most effective contract vehicle to ensure surge and sustainment coverage for surge events identified. Contracting officers must ensure go-to-war items identified during acquisition planning are included in solicitations for indefinite-delivery contracts, modifications adding items to a contract, or during option exercise.<span

>“Capability Assessment Plan (CAP)”</span
> means the offeror’s plan for covering S&amp;S requirements, identification of competing priorities for the same resources, and date when the S&amp;S capability can be attained. The offeror must provide the CAP as an attachment to its proposal when S&amp;S items are identified in the solicitation. If the offeror cannot meet S&amp;S quantity and delivery needs, the CAP must identify the shortfall and provide best value solutions, to include a proposed Government investment strategy to help offset the shortfall if needed.</p

><p
class="p-Normal"
>  (2) The contractor must maintain its S&amp;S capability to produce and deliver the S&amp;S quantity identified in Section C in accordance with the approved capability assessment plan (CAP) throughout the contract performance period. The contractor must participate in any S&amp;S testing and verification requested by the Government. The contractor agrees to support S&amp;S requirements to the maximum extent practical prior to achieving full S&amp;S capability required in Section C and the CAP; and for requirements exceeding those required in Section C and the CAP but not exceeding any applicable contract maximum quantity or contract value required in FAR 52.216-19. Changes that negatively impact S&amp;S capability must be reported in writing to the contracting officer within ten (10) working days after the contractor becomes aware of the impact. The notification must include a revised S&amp;S CAP containing proposed corrective actions and date when the S&amp;S capability will be attained.</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
>  (3) The Government reserves the right to verify and test the S&amp;S capability described in the CAP at any time during contract performance. The Government will prepare a test and verification plan and upon request the contractor must demonstrate its S&amp;S capability.   </p
><p
class="p-Normal"
>  (4)  If requested by the Government, the contractor must be prepared to provide a plan to participate in S&amp;S validation and testing to verify the S&amp;S capability described in the CAP. Participation in S&amp;S validation and testing will be at no additional expense to the Government, and does not justify an equitable adjustment to the contract price. The plan must include methodology, rating criteria, labor, materials, and time required to conduct validation and testing. S&amp;S validation generally entails verifying if the contractor and subcontractors have (a) sufficient equipment, facilities, personnel, stock, pre-positioned raw materials, production capabilities, and base resources; (b) agreements, networks, and plans for distribution (receiving, storing, packaging, and issuing); (c) transportation services to accommodate the S&amp;S requirements in the contract; (d) examination of any in-house work; (e) review of the stock rotation plan; and (f) other contracts that impact the production of added or accelerated delivery of contract quantities. The testing/verification plan is not required to be included in the offeror’s proposal. Offerors are encouraged to consider the possibility of the Government requesting this participation when formulating the proposal. </p

>If the buffer material is not available or the material is inadequate to complete the requirement, the contractor must contact the contracting officer representative (COR) for guidance. When a buffer has been established, the following process must be used to submit requests for buffer material.  A defense contractor (or sub-tier contractor supporting a prime contractor) with a current, active U.S. Government contract must submit a valid request to use a material buffer to the COR for the respective material buffer. The COR will review the submittal and approve or disapprove the request. -The request should include the following information:</p

class="p-Normal"
style="-ms-contextualSpacing: true; margin-bottom: 0pt; orphans: 1; widows: 1;"

><p
class="p-Normal"
style="-ms-contextualSpacing: true; margin-bottom: 0pt; orphans: 1; widows: 1;"
>  (2) If no prior contractual relationship exists between the defense contractor requesting access to the material buffer and -the material buffer contractor, the material buffer contractor is authorized to enter into a contract – to provide material from the buffer – once a valid request has been approved by the COR.  This action must be included in the monthly report submitted to the COR. When requests exceed the buffer’s maximum monthly material availability, the material supplier may negotiate phased delivery of material across the material monthly availability; or the Government COR may prioritize the release of the material at the Government’s discretion.</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
style="-ms-contextualSpacing: true; margin-bottom: 0pt; orphans: 1; widows: 1;"
>  (3) Contractors accessing the material buffer will be charged the material price identified in any pre-existing contract with the material buffer contractor. For those defense contractors not having a pre-existing contract with the material buffer contractor, they must be charged the standard (not spot market levels) pricing for the material. Contractors using the buffer are solely responsible for costs of using the buffer, and the Government has no liability either for these costs or for delays or other effects arising from the use of the buffer.</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
style="-ms-contextualSpacing: true; margin-bottom: 0pt; orphans: 1; widows: 1;"
>  (4) The buffer material provided is not Government-furnished material, but is a normal vendor-to-vendor transaction with all applicable warranties and guarantees provided through the commercial transaction.</p

>This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for soliciting offers, awarding contracts, placing orders, and post award administration under DLA’s tailored logistics support contracting initiatives. Included in this category are prime vendor (PV), similar existing support arrangements known as modified prime vendor initiatives (MPV), and future initiatives that have characteristics of PV arrangements but are not considered traditional PV. This subpart also discusses the management attention required throughout the life of a tailored logistics support contract. It includes a procurement note at <a

><span
class="c-Hyperlink"
>17.9504</span
></a
>(c) to be used when the Government relies on the contractor’s purchasing system to verify that the contractor competed the items or services, or justify fair and reasonable pricing. Any deviation from this subpart must be requested in writing to the DLA Acquisition Operations Division and be approved by the SPE. Deviations may be requested on a program rather than an individual acquisition basis.</p

>   (1) From the commencement of performance of this contract until 3 years after the final contract payment, the contractor must allow the contracting officer, ACO, Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), and any other duly authorized representative of the contracting officer access to all records and information pertaining to those items or services for which the Government is relying on the contractor’s purchasing system to determine that competition was obtained or to justify that prices are fair and reasonable. The contractor must maintain records subject to this clause for not less than 3 years after the contract final payment.</p

class="p-Normal"
style="-ms-tab0-pos: 34.55pt; -ms-tab0: left; margin-right: 11.1pt; orphans: 1; widows: 1;"
>  (2) The contracting officer may conduct reviews of purchased items or services provided under this contract regardless of dollar value that meet the criteria in paragraph (1) to ascertain whether the contractor has obtained the best value. The contractor must obtain competition to the maximum extent practicable for all purchases.  Prior to purchasing any supplies or services, the contractor must solicit a competitive quotation from at least two independently-competing firms. For other than sole source items, the request for quotations must, to the maximum extent practical, solicit offers from different manufacturers or producers.  If the contractor is unable to obtain quotes for competing items from two or more independently-competing firms, the contractor must retain documentation supporting its rationale for selection of the suppliers solicited and selected and its determination that the price was fair and reasonable. The contractor is responsible for maintaining this documentation for all sole source/non-competitive actions. The following price reasonableness and documentation requirements are applicable to all purchases, regardless of dollar value:</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
style="-ms-tab0-pos: 51.2pt; -ms-tab0: left; line-height: 16.9pt; orphans: 1; widows: 1;"
>         (i) A price is reasonable if it does not exceed a price incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business. The contracting officer will examine the prices with particular care in connection with buys that may not be subject to effective competition restraints. The contractor’s price will not be presumed to be reasonable.  If an initial review of the facts results in a challenge of a specific price by the contracting officer or the contracting officer’s representative, the burden of proof must be upon the contractor to establish that the price is reasonable under the standards in FAR Subpart 15.4 and FAR 31.201-3.</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
style="-ms-tab0-pos: 51.1pt; -ms-tab0: left; line-height: 16.9pt; orphans: 1; widows: 1;"
>         (ii) The contractor must keep the documentation to a minimum, but must retain data supporting the purchases either by paper or electronically. At a minimum, price quotations and invoices must be retained.  Should the contractor receive an oral price quotation, the contractor must document who the supplier or subcontractor is by complete name, address, telephone number, price, terms and other conditions quoted by each vendor. Price quotes for supplies must be broken down by individual items, shipping costs, and any other included expenses. Price quotes for incidental services which are not pre- priced in the contract must include labor hours and costs or prices, as applicable, including the total price of the job, individual pricing for the portions of the work if applicable, materials, and all other elements of cost, overhead, and profit. This price breakdown documentation must be made for each subcontractor performing work on this contract.</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
style="-ms-tab0-pos: 51.1pt; -ms-tab0: left; line-height: 16.9pt; orphans: 1; widows: 1;"
>  (3) When applicable, if the contractor is purchasing from subcontractors or other sources and receives a discount or rebates, the contractor must immediately pass these savings to the Government in the contract price and invoice for payment. The contractor is required to use diligence in the selection of the most economical method of delivery of the product or services by selecting a best value method of delivery based on the urgency and nature of the work or product required. When labor hours are involved in the work to be accomplished and the contractor has not already pre-priced the effort to use its own labor force, the contractor must provide the labor at rates required by the contract (for example, Service Contract Act or Davis-Bacon Act rates) or at rates based on competition if mandatory rates are not required by the contract.</p
><p
class="p-Normal"
style="-ms-tab0-pos: 51.1pt; -ms-tab0: left; line-height: 16.9pt; orphans: 1; widows: 1;"
>  (4) If the contracting officer determines that the purchased product or service is unreasonably priced, the contractor must refund to the Government the amount the contracting officer determines is in excess of a reasonable price. The contracting officer must notify the contractor in writing in accordance with FAR 32.604 Demand for Payment, giving the basis for the determination and the amount to be refunded. The contractor must make the refund payment in accordance with directions from the contracting officer, and must provide proof of the refund payment to the contracting officer. The contracting officer may collect the amount due using all available means in accordance with FAR Subpart 32.6. FAR 52.232-17, Interest, is applicable to payments not made within 30 days of the demand for payment. Any disputes arising under this provision must be handled in accordance with the “Disputes” clause of this contract.  </p
