<h3 class="Heading3">
<a id="P16_203_1"></a>16.203-1 Description.</h3>
<p class="List1">(a)(S-90) <em>Adjustment based on established prices. </em>Established prices may reflect industry&#8209;wide and/or geographically based market price fluctuations for commodity groups, specific supplies or services, or contract end items. (See <a href="https://dlamil.dps.mil/sites/Acquisition/Shared Documents/DoD Class Deviation - Economic Price Adjustment Clauses and DLAR Attachment October 5, 1995.pdf">DoD Class Deviation 1995-D0003, Economic Price Adjustment Clauses, issued October 5, 1995</a>.)</p>
<p class="List1">(c)(S-90) <em>Adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material.</em> These price adjustments may also be based on increases or decreases in indexes for commodity groups, specific supplies or services, or contract end items. (See <a href="https://dlamil.dps.mil/sites/Acquisition/Shared Documents/DoD Class Deviation - Economic Price Adjustment Clauses and DLAR Attachment October 5, 1995.pdf">DoD Class Deviation 1995-D0003, Economic Price Adjustment Clauses, issued October 5, 1995</a>.)<a id="se48.7.5416_1203_63"></a></p>
<p>(S-90) Although a specific item or element of cost may require EPA coverage, the contracting officer shall also determine whether an EPA clause should cover the entire end item in order to take advantage of competitive market forces or moderate price fluctuations. Base this decision, which may be an appropriate element of tradeoff in negotiations, on risk and price analyses of the alternatives. </p>
<p>(S-91) All FAR and DFARS EPA clauses and DLAD and procuring organization EPA procurement notes shall contain the contractor&rsquo;s warranty that the contract prices do not include allowance for any contingency to cover increased costs also considered by the EPA clause or procurement note. The contracting officer shall ensure that contractors comply with this warranty.</p>
<h3 class="Heading3">

<p>(S-92) If it becomes apparent that an EPA clause is clearly justified in a solicitation or contract but was not included, the contracting officer may include a FAR or DFARS EPA clause or DLAD or procuring organization EPA procurement note by solicitation amendment or bilateral contract modification.</p>
<p class="Default">(S-93) Send proposed DLAD and procuring organization EPA procurement notes to the DLA Acquisition Compliance, Policy and Pricing Division for approval. General Counsel shall review proposed DLAD and procuring organization EPA procurement notes.</p>

<a id="P16_203_3"></a><a id="P16_290"></a><a id="P16_203_4_a_2_90"></a>16.203-3 Limitations.</h3>
<p>(S-90) A fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment may also be used to provide for price adjustments as authorized in this section.

<h3 class="Heading3">
<a id="P16_203_4"></a>16.203-4 Contract clauses.</h3>
<p>(S-90) When the contracting officer determines an existing EPA clause is not appropriate, the contracting officer may develop and use another EPA clause in accordance with 16.203-1(a)(S-90) or (c)(S-90). Established prices and cost indexes need not reflect changes in the costs or established prices of a specific contractor. The established price or cost index may be derived from sales prices in the marketplace, quotes, or assessments as reported or made available in a consistent manner in a publication, electronic database, or other form, by an independent trade association, Governmental body, or other third party independent of the contractor. More than one established price or cost index may be combined in a formula for economic price adjustment purposes in the absence of an appropriate single price or cost index.

<p class="List1">(a) <em>Adjustments based on established prices &ndash; standard supplies.</em> If the contracting officer determines that no existing FAR or DFARS EPA clause, or DLAD or procuring organization EPA procurement note, is appropriate, the contracting officer may develop a procurement note for one-time use, subject to CCO approval in accordance with 1.301(a)(1)(S-92)(A).</p>
<p class="List2">(1) Contracting officers may use procurement note C13 in solicitations and contracts, when the contracting officer determines that the use of the clause at FAR 52.216-2 is inappropriate (reference FAR Deviation #2008-02).)</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>C13 Economic Price Adjustment &ndash; Standard Supplies (AUG 2017)</p>
<p class="List1">(a) The contractor warrants that the unit price stated in the schedule for [<em><em>offeror insert schedule line item number</em></em>] is not in excess of the contractor&rsquo;s applicable established price in effect on the contract date for like quantities of the same item. The term &ldquo;unit price&rdquo; excludes any part of the price directly resulting from requirements for preservation, packaging, or packing beyond standard commercial practice. The term &ldquo;established price&rdquo; means a price that &ndash;</p>
<p class="List2">(1) Is an established catalog or market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; and</p>
<p class="List2">(2) Is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the contractor.</p>
<p class="List1">(b) The contractor shall promptly notify the contracting officer of the amount and effective date of each decrease in any applicable established price. Each corresponding contract unit price shall be decreased by the same percentage that the established price is decreased. The decrease shall apply to those items ordered on and after the effective date of the decrease in the contractor&rsquo;s established price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly.</p>
<p class="List1">(c) If the contractor&rsquo;s applicable established price is increased after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price shall be increased, upon the contractor&rsquo;s written request to the contracting officer, by the same percentage that the established price is increased, and the contract shall be modified accordingly, subject to the following limitations:</p>
<p class="List2">(1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this procurement note shall not exceed 10 percent of the contract unit price [at the outset of each performance/ordering period].</p>
<p class="List2">(2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective &ndash;</p>
<p class="List3">(i) On the effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if the contracting officer receives the contractor&rsquo;s written request within 10 days thereafter; or</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the contracting officer receives the request.</p>
<p class="List2">(3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities ordered under the contract before the effective date of the increased contract unit price.</p>
<p class="List2">(4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the contracting officer verifies the increase in the applicable established price.</p>
<p class="List2">(5) Within 30 days after receipt of the contractor&rsquo;s written request, the contracting officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase.</p>
<p class="List1">(d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in subparagraph (c)(5) of this procurement note, and thereafter if there is no cancellation, the contractor shall continue deliveries according to the contract delivery schedule, and the Government shall pay for such deliveries at the contract unit price, increased to the extent provided by paragraph (c) of this clause.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p class="List2">(2) Contracting officers may use procurement note M09 for fresh fruits and vegetables under the DLA Troop Support subsistence supply chain for long term contracts (reference FAR Deviation #2008-02).</p>
<p class="List2">(3) Contracting officers may use a procuring organization EPA procurement note in any DLA Multiple Award Schedule solicitation or contract instead of FAR 52.216-2.</p>
<p class="List1">(b) <em>Adjustments based on established prices &ndash; semi-standard supplies. </em>The contracting officer may use a procuring organization EPA procurement note with FAR clause 52.216-3.</p>
<p class="List1">(c) <em>Adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material.</em></p>
<p class="List2">(1) The contracting officer may include an index clause in solicitations and resulting contracts only if the contracting officer documents in the acquisition plan that the acquisition satisfies the requirements of FAR 16.203-4(d) and DFARS 216.203-4(d). The contracting officer shall select the most appropriate index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The contracting officer may use another index if the contracting officer determines that no BLS index is suitable and documents in the acquisition plan the specific BLS indexes considered, why they were unsuitable, and rationale demonstrating the suitability of the index selected.</p>
<p class="List2">(2) If any applicable index is discontinued or its method of derivation is altered substantially, or the contracting officer determines that the index consistently and substantially fails to reflect market conditions, the parties shall agree upon an appropriate substitute index for determining price adjustments. The contracting officer shall modify the contract to reflect such substitute index, effective on the date the index specified in the contract is no longer published or began to consistently and substantially fail to reflect market conditions.</p>
<p class="List1">(d) <em>Price adjustment for Department of Labor Index.</em></p>
<p class="List2">(1) The contracting officer may use procurement note C09 in solicitations and contract awards when&mdash;</p>
<p class="List3">(i) Unpredictable increases or decreases in the cost of producing the items are expected or pricing uncertainties exist for a component or components of the end item, and the change in cost of production or component prices can be tracked via the Producers Price Index (PPI) published by the BLS; or unpredictable increases or decreases in the cost of producing the items are expected or pricing uncertainties exist for labor, and the change in cost of production can be tracked via the Employment Cost Index (ECI) published by the BLS.</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) The circumstances in FAR 16.203-4(d)(1) exist;</p>
<p class="List3">(iii) The contracting officer considers the use of this procurement note appropriate; and</p>
<p class="List3">(iv) The requirements of FAR 16.203-3 and DLAD Subpart 16.2 are met.</p>
<p class="List2">(2) The contracting officer shall coordinate with the procuring organization pricing office before selecting the index. For procuring organizations with no pricing office, the contracting officer shall coordinate the fill-in sections with the DLA Acquisition Contract &amp; Pricing Compliance Division.</p>
<p class="List2">(3) Notes for fill-in text:</p>
<p class="List3">(i) Paragraph (b)(1): Enter the appropriate Price Index (ECI, PPI, etc.) code number identification and title in the fill-in. Normally, unadjusted indexes should be used (as opposed to seasonally adjusted indexes). Note: If it is determined that the index to be used will only measure part of the cost of production or material, then that percentage which is measured can be specified. For example, if the component is cotton and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) index is only judged to measure 50% of the contract price, then this should be specified such as 50% times the base price.</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) Paragraph (b)(2): Enter the number of months, or quarters for ECI, for the adjusting price index.</p>
<p class="List3">(iii) Paragraph (b)(3): One box must be selected. Enter the number of months, or quarters for ECI, in each fill-in. Note: If final indexes are used, adjust the number of months, or quarters, in the second fill-in to account for first published indexes.</p>
<p class="List3">(iv) Paragraph (c)(1): Enter the number of price adjustments per contract year.</p>
<p class="List3">(v) Paragraph (d): Enter the appropriate percentage price increase ceiling, considering the length of contract performance, index volatility, and ratio of the cost covered by this clause to the total contract price. Any percentage over 10 percent requires approval by the chief of the contracting office.</p>
<p class="List3">(vi) Paragraph (f)(2): Enter the minimal dollar amount for an adjustment to be made for retroactive price changes. The default is $500.</p>

<p>(a) In the event of multiple awards, the contracting officer will consider each awardee for placement of individual task or delivery orders unless an exception at FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies. However, awardees subject to testing and approval requirements (e.g., first article testing) are not eligible to receive orders until testing requirements are satisfactorily completed. Failure to successfully complete required testing will constitute grounds for contract termination for default by the Government.</p>
<p>(b) Unless stated otherwise in the contract or in the request for quotes for task or delivery orders under this contract, the following evaluation process will be used in awarding task or delivery orders. The criteria used for evaluating offers for task or delivery orders under this contract are price, past performance, and delivery. Price is of ______ importance than or to the other factors combined. Past performance will include performance on orders previously placed under the contract and may include performance under other contracts. In evaluating performance under previous orders, the contracting officer will consider delivery, quality of supplies or services furnished, and success in implementing any socioeconomic support programs that may be applicable to the contract.</p>

<a id="P16_590"></a>16.590 Procurement notes.</h3>
<p class="List1">(a) Contracting officers may use procurement note L27 in solicitations when a method is needed for making additions or deletions to items covered by the contract (e.g., corporate contracts, LTCs incorporating a manufacturer&rsquo;s price list, comprehensive weapon system spare parts support, a specific range of items).</p>
<p class="List2">(1) The contracting officer shall address competition requirements before new items may be added to a contract.</p>
<p class="List2">(2) The contracting officer shall prepare a scope of contract statement in the solicitation and resulting contract to clearly establish the Government&rsquo;s intentions and rights under the contract. The scope of contract statement should communicate a comprehensive objective for the acquisition (i.e., whether it is based on a specific stock class, weapon system, product line, manufacturer, or distributor). The contracting officer shall not include information in the scope of contract statement that conflicts with Section B or other terms of the solicitation. Contracting officers have flexibility in defining contract scope but must be careful to avoid ambiguities.</p>
<p><a id="OLE_LINK13"></a><a id="OLE_LINK14"></a>*****</p>
<p>L27 Addition and Deletion of Items (AUG 2017)</p>
<p>(1) The Government reserves the right to unilaterally delete items that were available from only one manufacturer at the time of award if an alternate source of supply becomes available or the Government&rsquo;s requirements are modified to provide for full and open competition. The Government will provide a 30-day advance notice to the contractor prior to deleting any item from the contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Government may add new items to the contract through bilateral modification with negotiated prices. All new requirements are subject to synopsis prior to addition to the contract.</p>
<p>(3) Discontinued items:</p>
<p>(a) The contractor agrees to provide the Government with immediate, written notification when the manufacturer will discontinue an item, including a recommendation for any potential substitute or replacement items. If the Government elects to include a substitute or replacement item in the contract, the contracting officer will modify the contract accordingly.</p>
<p>(b) If the manufacturer discontinues an item without replacement, the contractor shall include in the notice a recommendation concerning the availability of items that are comparable in form, fit, and function. The contractor shall not incur any costs related to alternate sources of supply without the express written approval of the contracting officer. The Government has the option to make a last time order, or series of orders, within 30 days after receiving written notification of the discontinued item, after which the item will be deleted from the contract. The contractor shall honor any last time order, unless it is returned to the ordering office within 10 days after issuance with written notice stating the full quantity is not available for shipment. The parties will negotiate the terms of such orders, including changes to the delivery schedule and maximum quantity available for shipment.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p class="List1"><strong>(</strong>b) Contracting officers shall use procurement note C12 in solicitations and contract awards for LTCs that provide for shipment to more than one location and include quantity range pricing; when transportation costs will be relatively small compared to the cost of the item; and when the contract price will be f.o.b. origin.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>C12 Pricing of Delivery Orders with Quantity Increments (AUG 2017)</p>
<p class="List1">(a) In pricing delivery orders requiring delivery of one national stock number (NSN) to multiple destinations, the Government will determine the price for each destination as follows, depending on the box checked:</p>
<p> (1) The quantity range price based on the total quantity of the NSN being procured under each delivery order regardless of destination; or</p>
<p> (2) The total quantity being shipped to all destinations within each zone as defined elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p class="List1">(b) If this solicitation or contract contains a provision for placement of orders through an electronic ordering system, the Government will determine unit prices for those orders as follows, depending on the box checked:</p>
<p> (1) The total quantity of all requirements for each NSN issued via the electronic ordering system in a single day, regardless of the number of individual orders; or</p>
<p> (2) The quantity of each individual order.</p>
<p class="List1">(c) The minimum quantity to be ordered, per destination, will be the minimum ordering range quantity if specified in section B of the solicitation or contract for each item.</p>
