Electronic commerce/electronic data interchange (EC/EDI) transactions are often reformatted in transmission. Using these codes prevents misinterpretations within the system and increases accuracy in socioeconomic program reporting.</p>

The offeror shall select the one alpha code from the following listing that represents the offeror&rsquo;s business type. The offeror&rsquo;s recording of its business type in this procurement note by means of an alpha code replaces the marking of the appropriate boxes in FAR 52.219-1(b). Penalties for misrepresentation of business status apply (see FAR 52.219-1, paragraph (d)(2)).</p>
<p>Code B = Small Business. Enter code B if your firm is a small business concern, as defined in FAR 52.219-1, paragraph (a).</p>
<p>Code M = Small Disadvantaged Business. Enter code M if your firm is a small disadvantaged business concern, as defined in FAR 52.219-1, paragraph (a).</p>

<h3 class="Heading3">
<a id="P19_502_2"></a>19.502-2 Total small business set-asides.</h3>
<p><span style="color:#000000 !important">(a)(S-90) The contracting officer shall submit DD Form 2579, Small Business Coordination Record. When withdrawing a set-aside, the contracting officer shall document the reason on the DD Form 2579 or attach a memorandum for record supporting the decision and submit it to the procuring organization small business specialist for review. The contracting officer shall file all documents in the contract file or electronic contract folder.</span></p>
<h3 class="Heading3">
<a id="P19_505"></a>19.505 Rejecting Small Business Administration recommendations.</h3>
<p>(b) If the CCO approves the action of the contracting officer, the next level of appeal shall be the HCA. If the HCA approves the action of the contracting officer, the procurement center representative shall be so advised and may proceed with the appeal actions prescribed in FAR 19.505(c).</p>
<h3 class="Heading3">19.590 Cascading/combined set-aside logic clauses for Enterprise Business Systems applications.</h3>
<p>(a) Enterprise Business Systems<strong> (</strong>EBS) systems logic for automated procurements considers the applicability of more than one kind of set-aside in a combined or &ldquo;cascading&rdquo; fashion, based on the order of precedence in 19.590(b). EBS systems logic simultaneously accommodates service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) set-asides, HUBZone small business set-asides, and total small business set-asides, including exceptions and waivers to the non-manufacturers rule. If, at the time of solicitation, there is a reasonable expectation of receiving offers from two or more SDVOSBs or HUBZone small business concerns, the EBS software uses a combined set-aside for the automated solicitation. The Government encourages all small businesses to submit quotations. The applicable procurement notes inform offerors of the order of precedence that applies.</p>
<p>(b) If the acquisition is valued between the micro-purchase threshold and the SAT and there is a reasonable expectation of receiving competitive offers from two or more SDVOSB concerns and two or more HUBZone small business concerns, EBS will automatically issue an RFQ as a combined set-aside based on the following order of precedence:</p>
<p> (1) SDVOSB concerns.</p>
<p> (2) If no qualified quote is received from a SDVOSB concern, HUBZone small business concerns.</p>
<p> (3) If no qualified quote is received from a HUBZone concern, small business concerns and Federal Prison Industries (FPI).</p>
<p>(c) If the acquisition is valued between the micro-purchase threshold and the SAT and there is a reasonable expectation of receiving competitive offers from two or more SDVOSB concerns but not from two or more HUBZone concerns, EBS will automatically issue an RFQ as a combined set-aside based on the following order of precedence:</p>
<p> (1) SDVOSB concerns.</p>
<p> (2) If no qualified quote is received from a SDVOSB concern, small business concerns.</p>
<p> (3) If no qualified quote is received from a HUBZone concern, small business concerns and Federal Prison Industries (FPI).</p>
<p>(d) If the acquisition is valued between the micro-purchase threshold and the SAT and there is a reasonable expectation of receiving competitive offers from two or more HUBZone small business concerns but not from two or more SDVOSB concerns, EBS will automatically issue an RFQ as a combined set-aside based on the following order of precedence:</p>
<p> (1) HUBZone small business concerns. </p>
<p> (2) If no qualified quote is received from a HUBZone concern, small business concerns and Federal Prison Industries (FPI).</p>
<p>(e) If the acquisition is valued between the micro-purchase threshold and the SAT and there is a reasonable expectation of receiving competitive offers from two or more small businesses but not from two or more SDVOSB concerns or two or more HUBZone small business concerns, EBS will automatically issue an RFQ as a total small business set-aside.</p>
<p>(f) If, after combining and &ldquo;cascading&rdquo; these set-asides, no qualified quote is received from a small business concern at a fair market price, EBS will withdraw the set-aside and automatically resolicit on an unrestricted basis.</p>
