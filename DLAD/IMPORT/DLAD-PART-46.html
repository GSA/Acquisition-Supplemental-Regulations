<a id="P46_202_4"></a>46.202-4 Higher-level contract quality requirements.</h3>
<p class="List1">(a) The product specialist determines when higher-level contract quality requirements are required based on a review of the technical data package, ESA requirement, criticality and complexity of the item, or history of quality deficiencies. The product specialist will enter the higher-level contract quality requirement into the Document Management System, if applicable. The higher-level contract quality requirement will be incorporated into the PID in solicitations and contract awards from the Material Master. The higher-level contract quality requirement will be pre-populated in the fill-in for FAR clause 52.246-11.</p>
<h3 class="Heading3">
<a id="P46_290"></a>46.290 Certificate of quality compliance (COQC).</h3>
<p>A COQC is a quality assurance requirement in the form of a Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) (DD Form 1423-1) deliverable to provide objective quality evidence for materials submitted by the supplier. The DLA Logistics Operations Technical Programs and Quality Assurance Division maintains the CDRL in the Document Management System, and it is referenced in the Material Master.
