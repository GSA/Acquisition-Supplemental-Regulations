<h3 class="Heading3">
<a id="P15_402"></a>15.402 Pricing policy.</h3>
<p class="List1">(a)(3) When using a market basket or similar solicitation evaluation, contracting officers shall use one of the pricing models below. Ensure the items selected for the market basket represent the scope, extent, and complexity of the acquisition and all cost drivers. Cost drivers are high dollar value, high purchase frequency, and high volume items forecast for procurement. The contracting officer decides the cost driver population by analyzing historical demand data, expected future demand, and other relevant data. Final market baskets must represent the various types of items in the solicitation and advise the contracting officer of the expected cost to the Government. Post-award pricing strategies shall ensure fair and reasonable prices paid for all items purchased under the contract. The pricing strategy shall address how new items added to the contract and price changes to existing items under the contract will be determined fair and reasonable. See Subpart <a href="[rp:link:dlad-part-17]#P17_95">17.95</a> when the contracting officer relies on the contractor&rsquo;s purchasing system to corroborate the contractor competed items or services or to help in justifying the prices are fair and reasonable. Approved pricing models are below. New models or variations to these models must follow the requirements in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="List3">(i) Pricing Model: Fixed price using distribution and pricing agreement (DAPA) and Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing.</p>
<p><em> </em>(A) Program Example: Medical/Surgical and Pharmaceutical.</p>
<p> (B) Pre-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: Each item before award.</p>
<p> (C) Post-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: New items and price changes after award.</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) Pricing Model: Fixed price using market basket.</p>
<p class="List4">(A) Program Example: Subsistence CONUS and OCONUS.</p>
<p class="List4">(B) Pre-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: Each item in the market basket before award. The market basket must represent at least 40% of the estimated dollar value, with added items judgmentally selected to represent all distribution categories to the maximum extent possible. The market basket must contain a minimum of 75 items.</p>
<p class="List4">(C) Post-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: Each item before adding to the catalog.</p>
<p class="List3">(iii) Pricing Model: Fixed price using price evaluation list.</p>
<p class="List4">(A) Program Example: MRO Supplies.</p>
<p class="List4">(B) Pre-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: Each item before award. The price evaluation list must represent the scope, extent, and complexity of the acquisition, and include all cost drivers.</p>
<p class="List4">(C) Post-Award Price Reasonableness Determination:</p>
<p class="List6">(<em>1</em>) For line items below the micro- purchase threshold, a representative statistical sampling of lines meeting a 90% confidence level and a 10% error rate, determination is by 60 days after award.</p>
<p class="List6">(<em>2</em>) For line items with an extended value greater than or equal to the micro-purchase threshold and less than $10,000, at least 30% determined before award and the balance by 60 days after order.</p>
<p class="List6">(<em>3</em>) For line items with an extended value greater than or equal to $10,000, determination is for each item before order.</p>
<p class="List6">(<em>4</em>) Determination made for each item added or price change post award.</p>
<p class="List6">(<em>5</em>) Determination made for 100% of incidental services.</p>
<p class="List3">(iv) Pricing Model: Fixed price using price evaluation list.</p>
<p class="List4">(A) Program Example: Metals.</p>
<p class="List4">(B) Pre-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: Each item before award. The price evaluation list must represent the scope, extent, and complexity of the acquisition, and include all cost drivers.</p>
<p class="List4">(C) Post-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: Each item added, incidental service or price change.</p>
<p class="List3">(v) Pricing Model: Multiple award, fixed price using price evaluation list and competition of each order.</p>
<p class="List4">(A) Program Example: Special Operations Equipment, MRO Supplies (CENTCOM), Fire Fighting and Emergency Services Equipment, Wood Products.</p>
<p class="List4">(B) Pre-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: Each item before award.</p>
<p>The price evaluation list must represent the scope, extent, and complexity of the acquisition, and include all cost drivers.</p>
<p class="List4">(C) Post-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: Each item added or incidental service.</p>
<p>The contracting officer provides fair opportunity to compete for orders to all contract holders under FAR 16.505 (b).</p>
<p class="List3">(vi) Pricing Model: Fixed price using pre-priced core list.</p>
<p class="List4">(A) Program Example: MRO Supplies</p>
<p class="List4">(B) Pre-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: Each item before award. The price evaluation list must represent the scope, extent, and complexity of the acquisition, and include all cost drivers.</p>
<p class="List4">(C) Post-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: Each item added or incidental service or price change.</p>
<p class="List3">(vii) Pricing Model: Fixed price using pre-priced core list.</p>
<p class="List4">(A) Program Example: e.g. integrated prime vendor (IPV).</p>
<p class="List4">(B) Pre-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: Each item on the core list before award. The contracting officer places unpriced items representing the balance of total requirements in a Schedule. Competitively awarded core list using best value. Core list is a percentage of the total item requirements and must represent the scope, extent, and complexity of the acquisition, and includes all cost drivers.</p>
<p class="List4">(C) Post-Award Price Reasonableness Determination: Each item added or incidental service or price change. All requirements identified must be in the Core List. Only items on the Core List may be ordered.</p>

Contracting officers should use an index that captures historical or actual price changes such as an index from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). When projecting current prices into future periods, contracting officers shall rely on indexes that estimate future price changes such as Global Insight. The contracting officer shall consider the trend of the selected index.</p>
<p class="List3">(v) The contracting officer shall not use DLA standard price, budgetary estimates, provisioning estimates, stocking models (VSRM), and material acquisition unit price (MAUC) (unless based on recent purchases and escalated to the intended award date) for comparative price analysis and price reasonableness determinations.</p>

<p class="List1"><a id="P15_405_d_S90"></a>(d)(S-90).When award is still necessary, even though the contracting officer determines a price, profit, or fee is unreasonable, or when the contracting officer cannot determine if a price, profit, or fee is reasonable, the contracting officer shall refer the contract action to a level above the contracting officer in accordance with FAR 15.405(d). The cognizant authority above the contracting officer shall document any actions they completed or directed others to take in response to the referral and include this documentation, if applicable, when they provide the approval to the contracting officer. The cognizant authority at a level above the contracting officer shall include a statement for the contract file that they have reviewed the circumstances and approve of the award by the contracting officer. The contracting officer shall not make award without documented approval at a level above the contracting officer. The contracting officer shall forward a detailed memorandum to the CCO documenting the results of the negotiations and the reason the award is necessary. The contracting officer shall append a copy of this memorandum to the Price Negotiation Memorandum (PNM) in the contract file, if a PNM is applicable. If the contracting officer uses the SAAD format, in accordance with <a href="[rp:link:dlad-part-13]#P13_106_3_b">13.106-3(b)</a>, the contracting officer shall append the memorandum to the SAAD.</p>

<a id="P15_407_90"></a>15.407-90 Reverse Auction.</h3>
<p class="List1">(a) Policy.</p>
<p class="List2">(1) The contracting officer must consider using reverse auctions in solicitations for competitive procurements valued above the micro-purchase threshold. The contracting officer must document the contract file when competitive procurements do not use reverse auction above the SAT.</p>
<p class="List2">(2) When reverse auction is used, the contracting officer must use the DLA reverse auction pricing tool and enable the &ldquo;Lead/Not Lead&rdquo; feature when price is the sole evaluation factor.</p>
<p class="List2">(3) The CCO shall send reverse auction reports to reverse auction program manager in the DLA Acquisition Contract and Pricing Compliance Division by the close of business each Friday. Reports must include historical, direct, and indefinite-delivery contract savings. Indefinite-delivery contract savings are reported for each contract period. Report format is provided by reverse auction program manager. Negative reports required.</p>
<p class="List3">(i) Last price paid - final auction price X quantity = historical savings</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) Lowest offered pre-auction price - lowest offered post-auction price X quantity = direct savings</p>
<p class="List3">(iii) Direct savings X estimated annual quantities = indefinite-delivery contract estimated savings</p>
<p class="List3">(iv) Direct savings X actual quantities ordered during contract period = indefinite-delivery contract adjusted savings</p>
<p class="List1">(b) General guidance for selecting reverse auction candidates.</p>
<p class="List2">(1) A reverse auction is an internet-based or electronic commerce acquisition tool following traditional auction principles. It allows the Government to buy goods and services from offerors in a dynamic environment where offerors successively bid prices down until the auction ends.</p>
<p class="List2">(2) A reverse auction works well when competing an order for items or services on General Services Administration (GSA) schedules and DOD multiple-award indefinite-delivery type contracts. Conditions best suited for a reverse auction include high volume, commodity type commercial items or commodity-like services that do not have exact or lengthy specifications, are available off the shelf, or competed solely using price.</p>
<p class="List1">(c) Solicitations shall include procurement note L09 when the contracting officer may<strong> </strong>use a reverse auction.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>L09 Reverse Auction (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize reverse auctioning to conduct price discussions. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on<s> </s>initial offers or following discussions. If the Contracting Officer decides to use line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify Offerors of this decision and the following applies:</p>
<p>(1) The contracting officer may use reverse auction as the pricing technique during discussions to receive the final offered prices from each offeror.</p>
<p>(2) During each round of reverse auction, the system displays the lowest offer price(s) unless the auction instructions are different. All offerors and authorized auction users see the displayed lowest price(s). This disclosure is anonymous and a generic identifier displays for the offeror. Generic identifiers include designators such as &ldquo;offer A&rdquo; or &ldquo;lowest-priced offeror.&rdquo; By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction.</p>
<p>(3) An offeror&rsquo;s final auction price at the close of the reverse auction is considered its final price proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the contracting officer decides that further discussions are needed and final price proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.307, or the contracting officer determines that it would be in the best interest of the Government to re-open the auction.</p>
<p>(4) The contracting officer identifies participants to the DLA commercial reverse auction service provider. To be eligible for award and participate, the offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire solicitation and the commercial reverse auction service. The reverse auction pricing tool system administrator sends auction information in an email. The reverse auction system designates offers as "lead," meaning the current low price in that auction, or "not lead," meaning not the current low price in that auction. In the event of a tie offer, the reverse auction provider's system designates the first offer of that price as "lead" and the second or subsequent offer of that price as "not lead." If a tie offer is submitted and no evaluation factors other than price were identified in the solicitation or a low-price technically acceptable source selection is being used, the "Not Lead&rdquo; offeror that submitted the tie offer must offer a changed price; otherwise its offer will be ineligible for award. If evaluation factors in addition to price were listed in the solicitation and a tradeoff source selection is being used, tie offers that are "Not Lead" will be considered and evaluated.</p>
<p>(5) Offerors unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider&rsquo;s system during a reverse auction must notify the contracting officer or designated representative immediately. The contracting officer may, at their sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the offeror&rsquo;s inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the offeror and outside the offeror&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p>(6) Training. The commercial reverse auction service provider or government representative conducts training for offerors. Offerors receive training through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider&rsquo;s website, or other means. Trainers name employees successfully completing the training as a &ldquo;Trained Offeror.&rdquo; Only trained offerors may engage in a reverse auction. The contracting officer reserves the right to remove the &ldquo;trained offeror&rdquo; title from anyone who fails to obey the solicitation or commercial reverse auction service provider terms and conditions.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p class="List1">(d) Competing individual delivery orders through reverse auctioning. Contracting officers must use procurement note L10 when reverse auction may be used for some or all delivery orders issued against a multiple award contract with competitive ordering. Examples include FAR Subpart 8.4 requests for quotes and blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) when the BPA ordering process follows FAR 8.405-3(c)(2)(ii) or (iii).</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>L10 Competing Individual Delivery Orders Through Reverse Auctions (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>(1) A reverse auction may be used as the price negotiation technique when competing delivery orders under this contract. The contracting officer issues a request for proposal. After receiving proposals, the contracting officer will then send written notice via email to contractors with specifics about the reverse auction.</p>
<p>(2) Each contractor identified by the contracting officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by the DLA commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the contractor of the event and to provide an explanation of the process.</p>
<p>(3) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider&rsquo;s website, as embedded in the email notification. Participants shall be responsible for providing their own computer and Internet connection.</p>
<p>(4) Prior to the reverse auction, the Government will determine whether all participants&rsquo; prices, or just the lowest price(s), will be disclosed to other auction participants and to anyone else having authorized access to the auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each participant&rsquo;s identity will be concealed from other participants (although it will be known to the Government). If the Government opts to disclose one or more participant&rsquo;s prices, only generic identifiers will be used for each participant&rsquo;s proposed pricing (e.g., &ldquo;participant A or &ldquo;lowest priced participant&rdquo;). By submitting a proposal for a solicitation that includes this note, a contractor agrees to participate in the reverse auctions that will be conducted for award of specific delivery orders to be issued under the resulting multiple award contract, and that its quoted prices for a delivery order may be disclosed to other Contractors participating in the reverse auction.</p>
<p>(5) Any contractor unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider&rsquo;s system during a reverse auction must notify the contracting officer or designated representative immediately. The contracting officer may, at their sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the contractor&rsquo;s inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the participant and outside the contactor&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p>(6) Training. The commercial reverse auction service provider or government representative conducts training for offerors. Offerors receive training through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider&rsquo;s website, or other means. Trainers name employees successfully completing the training as a &ldquo;Trained Offeror.&rdquo; Only trained offerors may engage in a reverse auction. The contracting officer reserves the right to remove the &ldquo;trained offeror&rdquo; title from anyone who fails to obey the solicitation or commercial reverse auction service provider terms and conditions.</p>

<a id="P15_606"></a>15.606 Agency procedures.</h3>
<p class="List1">(a)(S-90) Organizations receiving an unsolicited proposal (UP) must forward them to their unsolicited proposal coordinator and the DLA Acquisition Operations UP program manager. The DLA Acquisition Operations UP program manager decides the correct unsolicited proposal coordinator(s) when needing evaluation by multiple organizations. Unsolicited proposal coordinators must:</p>
<p class="List3">(i) Coordinate and manage UPs;</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) Protect UPs from unauthorized disclosure (FAR 15.608 and 15.609); use cover sheet provided in FAR 15.609 for all stages of the Government&rsquo;s handling of a UP;</p>
<p class="List3">(iii) Advise UP program manager when a UP needs wider consideration in DLA;</p>
<p class="List3">(iv) Preserve accurate and complete disposition record of all UP processed;</p>
<p class="List3">(v) Ensure all affected evaluation offices and personnel follow FAR 15.608 and 15.609;</p>
<p class="List3">(vi) Ensure evaluators provide supporting reason for conclusions and recommendations. When recommending the UP for acceptance, ensure evaluators specify available funds or programmed funds; and</p>
<p class="List3">(vii) Send to contractors expressing interest in sending a UP the information in FAR 15.604(a)(1) through (6).</p>
<p class="List2">(S-91) Detailed procedures.</p>
<p class="List3">(i) The UP coordinator reviews the submission and decides if it meets all UP factors and sends written notice to the UP offeror within 15 days (follow FAR 15.601-1(b) or (c) as applicable). When the UP coordinator needs extra evaluation time, provide an interim response to the offeror within 15 days stating that more review is required, and that the final response is expected to be completed within 30 days from receipt of the submission, but that a further interim response will be provided at that time if evaluation cannot be completed, giving the estimated time for completion. The<s> </s>UP coordinator normally provides a final response within 30 days. When UP coordinator needs more than 30 days to evaluate, the coordinator or DLA Acquisition Operations UP program manager sends a notice to the offeror with the estimated completion date. The UP coordinator must complete the review in 90 days from UP receipt.</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) The coordinator forwards the UP submission to the correct technical or other personnel for evaluation. When evaluations need extra information, the coordinator contacts the UP offeror to request the information. The coordinator tells the offeror that it assumes all risk and expense for sending extra information, and that the request for extra information does not create a commitment by the government. The coordinator tells the DLA Acquisition Operations UP program manager they asked for added information.</p>
<p class="List3">(iii) Following the evaluation, the coordinator informs the offeror by letter of the final determination. If the submission is not a valid unsolicited proposal or is otherwise unacceptable, the letter states that determination and an explanation of the rationale in accordance with FAR 15.603(c) and 15.607(a), as applicable. If the submission is determined to be a valid UP, the coordinator informs the offeror and includes a caution, in accordance with FAR 15.607(a), that a favorable comprehensive evaluation of an unsolicited proposal does not, in itself, justify awarding a contract without providing for full and open competition and that the unsolicited proposal will be provided to an appropriate contracting officer for a determination of whether further action is appropriate in accordance with FAR 15.607(b).</p>
<p class="List3">(iv) On receiving a valid UP from the coordinator, the responsible contracting officer will decide the correct contract action, if any, following FAR 15.607(b) and coordinating with the correct requiring activity. If the contracting officer determines that the UP represents a valid requirement and the conditions for proceeding with a procurement are met, the contracting officer must provide for full and open competition or justify limiting sources, as applicable. The contracting officer notifies offeror in writing if negotiations in accordance with FAR 15.607(b) will commence.</p>
