         <p xtrc="P">As prescribed in HHSAR 319.270-1(a), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following provision:
</p>
                                    <p xtrc="HD1">Mentor-Protégé Program (DEC 2015)
</p>
                                    <p outputclass="List1">(a) Large business prime contractors serving as mentors in the HHS Mentor-Protégé Program are eligible for HHS subcontracting plan credit, and shall submit a copy of their HHS Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU)-approved mentor-protégé agreements as part of their offers. The amount of credit provided by the Contracting Officer to a mentor firm for protégé firm developmental assistance costs shall be calculated on a dollar for dollar basis and reported by the mentor firm in the Summary Subcontract Report via the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) at <i>www.esrs.gov</i>. The mentor firm and protégé firm shall submit to the Contracting Officer a signed joint statement agreeing on the dollar value of the developmental assistance the mentor firm provided. (For example, a mentor firm would report a $10,000 subcontract awarded to a protégé firm and provision of $5,000 of developmental assistance as $15,000 of subcontracting plan credit.) The mentor firm may use this additional credit towards attaining its subcontracting plan participation goal under this contract.
