However, the Contractor shall grant a license in the Class 2 Subject Inventions to the provider of the Material or other party designated by the Agency as set forth in Alternate I.</p>

<p>(iii) Class 3 Subject Inventions shall be governed by <font color="#0053cc"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR52.227.doc#b5222711. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/52_227.htm#P119_15995"><u>FAR clause 52.227-11</u></a></font>, Patent Rights-Ownership by the Contractor (December 2007) (previously incorporated herein by reference).</p>

<p>&nbsp;(3) <b>Greater Rights Determinations</b>.&nbsp;The Contractor, or an employee-inventor after consultation by the Agency with the Contractor, may request greater rights than are provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause in accordance with the procedures of FAR paragraph <font color="#0053cc"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR27.DOC#b273041. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/27.htm#P206_38657"><u>27.304-1(c)</u></a></font>. In addition to the considerations set forth in paragraph <font color="#0053cc"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR27.DOC#b273041. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/27.htm#P206_38657"><u>27.304-1(c)</u></a></font>, the Agency may consider whether granting the requested greater rights will interfere with rights of the Government or any Third party assignee or otherwise impede the ability of the Government or the Third party assignee to, for example, develop and commercialize new compounds, dosage forms, therapies, preventative measures, technologies, or other approaches with potential for the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment of human diseases.</p>

<p>A request for a determination of whether the Contractor or the employee-inventor is entitled to retain such greater rights must be submitted to the Agency Contracting Officer at the time of the first disclosure of the invention pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or not later than 8 months thereafter, unless a longer period is authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor. Each determination of greater rights under this contract shall be subject to paragraph (c) of the FAR clause at <font color="#0053cc"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR52.227.doc#b5222713. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/52_227.htm#P183_34934"><u>52.227-13</u></a></font> (incorporated herein by reference), and to any reservations and conditions deemed to be appropriate by the Agency such as the requirement to assign or exclusively license the rights to Subject Inventions to the Third party assignee.</p>

<p>A determination by the Agency denying a request by the Contractor for greater rights in a Subject Invention may be appealed within 30 days of the date the Contractor is notified of the determination to an Agency official at a level above the individual who made the determination. If greater rights are granted, the Contractor must file a patent application on the invention. Upon request, the Contractor shall provide the filing date, serial number and title, a copy of the patent application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English), and patent number and issue date for any Subject Invention in any country for which the Contractor has retained title. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Government an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of the patent application file.</p>

<p>(c) <b>Invention disclosure by Contractor</b>. The Contractor shall disclose in writing each Subject Invention to the Agency Contracting Officer and to the Director, Division of Extramural Inventions and Technology Resources (DEITR), if directed by the Contracting Officer, as provided in paragraph (j) of this clause within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to the Agency Contracting Officer shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was Made and all inventors. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale (offer for sale), or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication, and if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure.</p>

<p>In addition, after disclosure to the Agency, the Contractor will promptly notify the Contracting Officer and DEITR of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Contractor. If the Contractor assigns a Subject Invention to the Third party assignee, then the Contractor and its employee inventors shall assist the Third party assignee in securing patent protection. All costs of securing the patent, including the cost of the Contractor's assistance, are at the Third party's expense. Any assistance provided by the Contractor and its employee inventors to the Third party assignee or other costs incurred in securing patent protection shall be solely at the Third party's expense and not billable to the contract.</p>

<p>&nbsp;(d) <b>Contractor action to protect the Third party assignee's and the Government's interest</b><i>.</i>&nbsp;(1) The Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to the Agency all instruments necessary to: Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in Subject Inventions pursuant to paragraph (b) of this clause; convey title to a Third party assignee in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause; and enable the Third party assignee to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that Subject Invention.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor, each Subject Invention “Made” under contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on Subject Inventions and to establish the Government's rights or a Third party assignee's rights in the Subject Inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.</p>

<p>(3) If the Contractor is granted greater rights, the Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States non-provisional patent application it files, and any patent issuing thereon, covering a Subject Invention the following statement: “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the Contract) awarded by (identify the specific Agency). The Government has certain rights in the invention.”</p>

<p>(4) The Contractor agrees to provide a final invention statement and certification prior to the closeout of the contract listing all Subject Inventions or stating that there were none.</p>

<p>(e) <b>Subcontracts</b><i>.</i>&nbsp;(1) The Contractor will include this clause in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work. At all tiers, the clause must be modified to identify the parties as follows: References to the Government are not changed, and the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause. The Contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the contract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's Subject Inventions.</p>

<p>(2) In subcontracts, at any tier, the Agency, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Agency with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of FAR clause <font color="#0053cc"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR52.227.doc#b5222713. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/52_227.htm#P183_34934"><u>52.227-13</u></a></font>.</p>

<p>(f) <b>Reporting on utilization of Subject Inventions in the event greater rights are granted to the Contractor</b>.&nbsp;The Contractor agrees to submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a Subject Invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees when a request under subparagraph b.3. has been granted by the Agency. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and information as the Agency may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by the Agency in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by the Agency in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), the Agency agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor.</p>

<p>(g) Preference for United States industry in the event greater rights are granted to the Contractor. Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any Subject Invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the Subject Invention or produced through the use of the Subject Invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by the Agency upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;(h) <b>March-in rights in the event greater rights are granted to the Contractor</b>.&nbsp;The Contractor acknowledges that, with respect to any Subject Invention in which it has acquired ownership through the exercise of the rights specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause, the Agency has the right to require licensing pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210(c), and in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of Agency in effect on the date of contract award.</p>

<p>(i) <b>Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations in the event greater rights are granted to the Contractor</b>. If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it shall:</p>

<p>(1) Not assign rights to a Subject Invention in the United States without the written approval of the Agency, except where an assignment is made to an organization that has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions, provided that the assignee shall be subject to the same provisions as the Contractor;</p>

<p>(2) Share royalties collected on a Subject Invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (but through their Agency if the Agency deems it appropriate) when the Subject Invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;</p>

<p>(3) Use the balance of any royalties or income earned by the Contractor with respect to Subject Inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of Subject Inventions for the support of scientific research or education;</p>

<p>(4) Make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of Subject Inventions that are small business concerns, and give a preference to a small business concern when licensing a Subject Invention if the Contractor determines that the small business concern has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business concerns; provided, that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business concern has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Contractor; and</p>

<p>(5) Allow the Secretary of Commerce to review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when the Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of paragraph (i)(4) of this clause.</p>

<p>(j) <b>Communications</b><i>. </i>All invention disclosures and requests for greater rights shall be sent to the Agency Contracting Officer, as directed by the Contracting Officer. Additionally, a copy of all disclosures, confirmatory licenses to the Government, face page of the patent applications, waivers and other routine communications under this funding agreement at all tiers must be sent to:</p>

<p>These regulations provide a systematic means, based on established ethical principles, to safeguard the rights and welfare of human subjects participating in research activities supported or conducted by HHS.</p>

<p>(b) The regulations define a human subject as a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data or identifiable public information through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information. In most cases, the regulations extend to the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from individually identifiable human subjects as well as to graphic, written, or recorded information derived from individually identifiable human subjects. <b>45 CFR part 46 does not directly regulate the use of autopsy materials; instead, applicable state and local laws govern their use.</b></p>
