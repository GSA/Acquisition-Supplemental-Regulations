         <p class="p List2">(1) Notify the challenger of the date it was received, and that the representation of the enterprise being challenged is under consideration; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Furnish to the offeror (whose representation is being challenged) a request to provide detailed information on its eligibility by certified mail, return receipt requested or email.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Within 3 calendar days after receiving a copy of the challenge and the CO's request for detailed information, the challenged offeror must file, as specified at (d)(2), with the CO a complete statement answering the allegations in the challenge and furnish evidence to support its position on representation. If the offeror does not submit the required material within the 3 calendar days, or another period of time granted by the CO, the CO may assume that the offeror does not intend to dispute the challenge and must not award to the challenged offeror.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Within 10 calendar days after receiving a challenge, the challenged offeror's response, and any other pertinent information, the CO must determine the representation status of the challenged offeror and notify the challenger and the challenged offeror of the decision by certified mail, return receipt requested or email, and make known to all parties the option to appeal the determination to IHS DAP.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) If the representation accompanying an offer is challenged and subsequently upheld by DAP, the written notification of this action must state the reason(s).

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Award of a contract in the face of challenge only may be made on the basis of the CO's written determination that the challenged offeror's representation is valid.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) This determination is final unless it is appealed to DAP, and the CO is notified of the appeal before award.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If an award was made before the CO received notice of appeal, the contract is presumed to be valid.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) After receiving a challenge involving an offeror being considered for award, the CO must not award the contract until the CO has determined the validity of the representation. Award may be made in the face of a timely challenge when the CO determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest, is urgently required, or a prompt award will otherwise be advantageous to the Government.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) If a timely challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received before award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO must notify eligible offerors within one day that the award will be withheld. The CO also may ask eligible offerors to extend the period for acceptance of their proposals.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) If a challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received after award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO need not suspend contract performance or terminate the awarded contract unless the CO believes that an award may be invalidated and a delay would prejudice the Government's interest. However, if contract performance is to be suspended, the CO would follow those guidelines as outlined in FAR Part 49.
