         <p xtrc="P">In accordance with internal agency procedures, a contracting officer may designate other qualified personnel to be the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for the purpose of performing certain technical functions in administering a contract. These functions include, but are not limited to, technical monitoring, inspection, approval of shop drawings, testing, and approval of samples. The COR acts solely as a technical representative of the contracting officer and is not authorized to perform any function that results in a change in the scope, price, terms or conditions of the contract. COR designations must be made in writing by the contracting officer, and shall identify the responsibilities and limitations of the designation. A copy of the COR designation must be furnished to the contractor and the contract administration office.
