<p>(d)(1) Where the cost to the Government may be affected, approval of hours of work in excess of the normal workweek is justified only in those instances and for those employees where it can be shown that overtime would provide needed and demonstrable impetus to the accomplishment of Department of Energy (DOE) objectives and that all other means of meeting these objectives have been considered and found inadequate or not feasible. Accordingly, the Heads of Contracting Activities shall—</p>

<p>(i) Establish controls to prevent excess casual overtime and to assure that such overtime work is in the best interest of the Government. Casual overtime means— </p>

<p>(A) Work in excess of the normal workweek (or in excess of an authorized extended workweek) which cannot be regularly scheduled in advance; or </p>

<p>(B) Regularly scheduled work in excess of the normal workweek for a period of four consecutive weeks or less; and</p>

<p>(ii) Establish controls to assure that any use of any extended workweek schedule is in the best interest of the Government. Extended workweek means a workweek regularly scheduled and established in excess of the normal workweek for a period in excess of four consecutive weeks.</p>

<p>[49 FR 11998, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9106, Feb. 25, 1994; 74 FR 36365, July 22, 2009]</p>

<p><a name="P12_1544"></a><b>922.103-5   Contract clauses.</b></p>

<p>In accordance with 48 CFR 22.101-1(e) and 48 CFR 22.103-5, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 48 CFR 52.222-1, Notice to the Government of Labor Disputes, in all solicitations and contracts for protective services at DOE owned facilities requiring continuity of services for public safety and national security reasons. The contracting officer may insert this clause in other solicitations and contracts where a significant need for continuity in contract performance exists. See subpart 937.70, Protective Services Contracting, for additional policy guidance regarding protective services.</p>

<p>[58 FR 36151, July 6, 1993, as amended at 74 FR 36365, July 22, 2009; 75 FR 69012, Nov. 10, 2010]</p>

<p>This subpart implements 48 CFR part 22, subpart 22.8. It applies to all DOE contracts and subcontracts.</p>

<p>[49 FR 11998, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9106, Feb. 25, 1994; 75 FR 69012, Nov. 10, 2010]</p>

<p>(a) The Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs of the Department of Labor has been delegated authority and responsibility for carrying out the requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended. In conjunction with the delegation, contracting officers shall be familiar with existing and any updated provisions of 41 CFR Ch. 60, and assist the Department of Labor in its compliance responsibilities. DOE contracting officers will include the applicable Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)) and Affirmative Action Program (AAP) requirements in their solicitations and obtain the applicable reports of compliance from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) (when required) prior to awarding of contracts. The provisions of 41 CFR Ch. 60, are applicable to all DOE contracts.</p>

<p>(d) The OFCCP requires that requests for pre-award clearances be directed to the OFCCP Regional Office in which the contractor's facility is (to be) located. If OFCCP finds the contractor in compliance, the contracting officer will be notified. Findings of non-compliance can be communicated to the contracting officer by the OFCCP or Headquarters Director or his designee. The appropriate Regional Office will provide the appropriate contact point in cases of non-compliance. The Director, Office of Civil Rights (DOE HQ), when requested, will provide assistance to contracting officers resolving non-compliance issues by providing assistance in obtaining a final decision from the OFCCP.</p>
