</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for default either if the Contractor fails to meet obligations imposed by this clause or if the Contractor creates a foreign ownership, control, or influence situation in order to avoid performance or a termination for default. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience if the Contractor becomes subject to foreign ownership, control, or influence and for reasons other than avoidance of performance of the contract, cannot, or chooses not to, avoid or mitigate the foreign ownership, control, or influence problem.

Information to be provided by a subcontractor pursuant to this clause may be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer. For purposes of this clause, subcontractor means any subcontractor at any tier and the term “Contracting Officer” means the DOE Contracting Officer. When this clause is included in a subcontract, the term “Contractor” shall mean subcontractor and the term “contract” shall mean subcontract.</p>

A Facility Clearance is based upon a determination that satisfactory safeguards and security measures are carried out for the activities being performed at the facility. It is DOE policy that all Contractors or Subcontractors requiring access authorizations be processed for a Facility Clearance at the level appropriate to the activities being performed under the contract. Approval for a Facility Clearance shall be based upon -

Prior to award of a contract, the DOE must determine that award of the contract to the offeror will not pose an undue risk to the common defense and security as a result of its access to classified information or special nuclear material in the performance of the contract. The Contracting Officer may require the offeror to submit such additional information as deemed pertinent to this determination.
</p>

This type facility is identified as a non-possessing facility.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(f) Except as otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the provisions of any resulting contract must require that the Contractor insert provisions similar to the foregoing in all subcontracts and purchase orders.

                                    <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 and agency licensing regulations. This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and agency regulations concerning the licensing of Government owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.

				</p>
<p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to DOE all instruments necessary to (i) establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions to which the Contractor elects to retain title, and (ii) convey title to DOE when requested under paragraph (d) of this clause and to enable the government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) The Contractor will notify DOE of any decision not to continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) The Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent application and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement, “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by the United States Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.”
</p>
                                    <p class="p Runin List1">(g) <em class="ph i">Subcontracts.</em> 
				</p>
<p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Contractor will include this clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization. The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the Contractor in this clause, and the Contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) The contractor shall include in all other subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration, or research work the patent rights clause at 952.227-13.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, DOE, subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(h) <em class="ph i">Reporting on utilization of subject inventions.</em> The Contractor agrees to submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received, by the Contractor, and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by that agency in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(i) <em class="ph i">Preference for United States industry.</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

                                    <p class="p List1">(j) <em class="ph i">March-in rights.</em> The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of the agency to require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and, if the Contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself if DOE determines that - 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their licensees;
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph

<p class="p List3">(i) 
			of this clause has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.

                                    <p class="p List2">(1) Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned without the approval of the Federal agency, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions; provided, that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the Contractor;
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor will share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (when DOE deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the Contractor with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions will be utilized for the support of scientific research or education; and
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms, and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the contractor. However, the Contractor agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and the Contractor will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when that Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of this subparagraph (k)(4).

<p class="p List2">(1)

</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) Each exercise of discretion or decision provided for in this clause, except subparagraph (k)(4), is reserved for the DOE Patent Counsel and is not a claim or dispute and is not subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.

To the extent data or information supplied under this section is considered by the Contractor, its licensee, or assignee to be privileged and confidential and is so marked, the Department of Energy agrees that, to the extent permitted by law, it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(iv) The Contractor agrees, when licensing a subject invention, to arrange to avoid royalty charges on acquisitions involving Government funds, including funds derived through a Military Assistance Program of the Government or otherwise derived through the Government, to refund any amounts received as royalty charges on a subject invention in acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the Government, and to provide for such refund in any instrument transferring rights in the invention to any party.

The Contractor's license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a part and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions in 37 CFR part 404 and agency licensing regulations. This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical applications and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable agency licensing regulations and 37 CFR part 404 concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) The Contractor may request the right to acquire patent rights to a subject invention in any foreign country where the Government has elected not to secure such rights, subject to the conditions in subparagraphs (d)(4)

<p class="p List3">(i) 
			through (d)(4)(vii) of this clause. Such request must be made in writing to the Patent Counsel as part of the disclosure required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause, with a copy to the DOE Contracting Officer. DOE approval, if given, will be based on a determination that this would best serve the national interest.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) The recipient of such rights, when specifically requested by DOE, and three years after issuance of a foreign patent disclosing the subject invention, shall furnish DOE a report stating:

                                    <p class="p List4">(A) The commercial use that is being made, or is intended to be made, of said invention, and

</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(v) Subject to the rights granted in subparagraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause, the Secretary of Energy or designee shall have the right, commencing four years after foreign patent rights are accorded under this subparagraph (d)(4), to require the granting of a nonexclusive or partially exclusive license to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms reasonable under the circumstances, and in appropriate circumstances to terminate said foreign patent rights in whole or in part, following a hearing upon notice thereof to the public, upon a petition by an interested person justifying such hearing:
</p>
                                    <p class="p List4">(A) If the Secretary of Energy or designee determines, upon review of such material as he deems relevant, and after the recipient of such rights or other interested person has had the opportunity to provide such relevant and material information as the Secretary or designee may require, that such foreign patent rights have tended substantially to lessen competition or to result in undue market concentration in any section of the United States in any line of commerce to which the technology relates; or
</p>
                                    <p class="p List4">(B) Unless the recipient of such rights demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or designee at such hearing that the recipient has taken effective steps, or within a reasonable time thereafter is expected to take such steps, necessary to accomplish substantial utilization of the invention.

                                    <p class="p List3">(vi) If the contractor is to file a foreign patent application on a subject invention, the Government agrees, upon written request, to use its best efforts to withhold publication of such invention disclosures for such period of time as specified by Patent Counsel, but in no event shall the Government or its employees be liable for any publication thereof.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(vii) Subject to the license specified in subparagraphs (d) (1), (2), and (3) of this clause, the contractor or inventor agrees to convey to the Government, upon request, the entire right, title, and interest in any foreign country in which the contractor or inventor fails to have a patent application filed in a timely manner or decides not to continue prosecution or to pay any maintenance fees covering the invention. To avoid forfeiture of the patent application or patent, the contractor or inventor shall, not less than 60 days before the expiration period for any action required by any patent office, notify the Patent Counsel of such failure or decision, and deliver to the Patent Counsel, the executed instruments necessary for the conveyance specified in this paragraph.

				</p>
<p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to assure that subject inventions are promptly identified and disclosed to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters within 6 months of conception and/or first actual reduction to practice, whichever occurs first in the performance of work under this contract. These procedures shall include the maintenance of laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as are reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual reduction to practice of subject inventions, and records that show that the procedures for identifying and disclosing the inventions are followed. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a description of such procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their effectiveness.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor shall disclose each subject invention to the DOE Patent Counsel with a copy to the Contracting Officer within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters or, if earlier, within 6 months after the Contractor becomes aware that a subject invention has been made, but in any event before any on sale, public use, or publication of such invention known to the Contractor. The disclosure to DOE shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding, to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and physical, chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale, or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to DOE, the Contractor shall promptly notify Patent Counsel of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Contractor. The report should also include any request for a greater rights determination in accordance with subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause. When an invention is disclosed to DOE under this paragraph, it shall be deemed to have been made in the manner specified in Sections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 42 U.S.C. 5908, unless the Contractor contends in writing at the time the invention is disclosed that is was not so made.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the following:

                                    <p class="p List3">(i) Interim reports every 12 months (or such longer period as may be specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract, listing all subject inventions during that period, and including a statment that all subject inventions have been disclosed (or that there are not such inventions), and that such disclosure has been made in accordance with the procedures required by paragraph (e)(1) of this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the contracted work listing all subject inventions or containing a statement that there were no such inventions, and listing all subcontracts at any tier containing a patent right clause or containing a statement that there were no such subcontracts.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(5) The Contractor agrees, subject to FAR 27.302(j), that the Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) Any such inventions are subject inventions;
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) The Contractor has established and maintains the procedures required by subparagraphs (e) (1) and (4) of this clause;
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the procedures.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor invention which the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject invention, the Contractor may be required to disclose the invention to DOE for a determination of ownership rights.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Any examination of records under this paragraph will be subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.

                                    <p class="p List2">(1) Any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount of this contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to - 
</p>

                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for identifying and disclosing subject inventions pursuant to subparagraph (e)(1) of this clause;
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(iii) Disclose any subject invention pursuant to subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause;

                                    <p class="p List3">(v) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to subparagraph (h)(4) of this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other information required by this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Final payment under this contract shall not be made before the Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer all disclosures of subject inventions required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause, and acceptable final report pursuant to subparagraph (e)(3)(ii) of this clause, and the Patent Counsel has issued a patent clearance certification to the Contracting Officer.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums withheld up to the maximum authorized above. No amount shall be withheld under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government rights.

<p class="p List2">(1) 
			The contractor shall include the clause at 48 CFR 952.227-11 (suitably modified to identify the parties) in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration, or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization, except where the work of the subcontract is subject to an Exceptional Circumstances Determination by DOE. In all other subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration, or research work, the contractor shall include this clause (suitably modified to identify the parties). The contractor shall not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to accept such a clause the Contractor - 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; and
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) Shall not proceed with such subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) In the case of subcontracts at any tier, DOE, the subcontractor, and Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to those matters covered by this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(5) The contractor shall identify all subject inventions of the subcontractor of which it acquires knowledge in the performance of this contract and shall notify the Patent Counsel, with a copy to the contracting officer, promptly upon identification of the inventions.

However, in individual cases, the requirement may be waived by the Government upon a showing by the Contractor or assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

				</p>
<p class="p List2">(1) 
			<em class="ph i">Background patent</em> means a domestic patent covering an invention or discovery which is not a subject invention and which is owned or controlled by the Contractor at any time through the completion of this contract:
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) Which the contractor, but not the Government, has the right to license to others without obligation to pay royalties thereon, and

</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government a royalty-free, nonexclusive license under any background patent for purposes of practicing a subject of this contract by or for the Government in research, development, and demonstration work only.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) The Contractor also agrees that upon written application by DOE, it will grant to responsible parties, for purposes of practicing a subject of this contract, nonexclusive licenses under any background patent on terms that are reasonable under the circumstances. If, however, the Contractor believes that exclusive rights are necessary to achieve expeditious commercial development or utilization, then a request may be made to DOE for DOE approval of such licensing by the Contractor.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) Notwithstanding subparagraph (k)(3) of this clause, the contractor shall not be obligated to license any background patent if the Contractor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or designee that:
</p>

In order that public disclosure of such information will not adversely affect the patent interests of DOE or the Contractor, patent approval for release of publication shall be secured from Patent Counsel prior to any such release or publication.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) Prepares a written decision based upon a review of the record that the invention was neither conceived nor first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under the contract and delivers the decision to Patent Counsel, with a copy to the Contracting Officer; or
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) Contending that the invention is not a subject invention, the Contractor nevertheless discloses the invention and all facts pertinent to this contention to the Patent Counsel, with a copy to the Contracting Officer; or

                                    <p class="p List3">(iii) Establishes that the failure to disclose did not result from the Contractor's fault or negligence.

Even where such advance waiver is not requested or the request is denied, the contractor will have a continuing right under the contract to request a waiver of the rights of the United States in identified inventions, i.e., individual inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance of the contract. Domestic small businesses and domestic nonprofit organizations normally will receive the patent rights clause at DEAR 952.227-11 which permits the contractor to retain title to such inventions, except under contracts for management or operation of a Government-owned research and development facility or under contracts involving exceptional circumstances or intelligence activities. Therefore, small businesses and nonprofit organizations normally need not request a waiver. See the patent rights clause in the draft contract in this solicitation.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) The Contractor is responsible for maintaining the integrity of research performed pursuant to this contract award including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct as defined by this clause, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations, and adjudication of allegations of research misconduct in accordance with the requirements of this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(b) Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor must conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of research misconduct.

The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Inform the Contracting Officer if an initial inquiry supports a formal investigation and, if requested by the Contracting Officer thereafter, keep the Contracting Officer informed of the results of the investigation and any subsequent adjudication. When an investigation is complete, the Contractor will forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response (if any).

                                    <p class="p List1">(d) In conducting the activities under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause, the Contractor and the Department, if it elects to conduct the inquiry or investigation, shall adhere to the following guidelines:
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Safeguards for information and subjects of allegations.</em> The Contractor shall provide safeguards to ensure that individuals may bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of the Contractor without suffering retribution. Safeguards include: protection against retaliation; fair and objective procedures for examining and resolving allegations; and diligence in protecting positions and reputations. The Contractor shall also provide the subjects of allegations confidence that their rights are protected and that the mere filing of an allegation of research misconduct will not result in an adverse action. Safeguards include timely written notice regarding substantive allegations against them, a description of the allegation and reasonable access to any evidence submitted to support the allegation or developed in response to an allegation and notice of any findings of research misconduct.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Objectivity and expertise.</em> The Contractor shall select individual(s) to inquire, investigate, and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct who have appropriate expertise and have no unresolved conflict of interest. The individual(s) who conducts an adjudication must not be the same individual(s) who conducted the inquiry or investigation, and must be separate organizationally from the element that conducted the inquiry or investigation.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Timeliness.</em> The Contractor shall coordinate, inquire, investigate and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct promptly, but thoroughly. Generally, an investigation should be completed within 120 days of initiation, and adjudication should be complete within 60 days of receipt of the record of investigation.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Confidentiality.</em> To the extent possible, consistent with fair and thorough processing of allegations of research misconduct and applicable law and regulation, knowledge about the identity of the subjects of allegations and informants should be limited to those with a need to know.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(5) <em class="ph i">Remediation and sanction.</em> If the Contractor finds that research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process. The Contractor must take all necessary corrective actions. Such action may include but are not limited to, correcting the research record and as appropriate imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future. The Contractor must coordinate remedial actions with the Contracting Officer. The Contractor must also consider whether personnel sanctions are appropriate. Any such sanction must be considered and effected consistent with any applicable personnel laws, policies, and procedures, and shall take into account the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact, whether it was done knowingly or intentionally, and whether it was an isolated event or pattern of conduct.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(e) DOE reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the award instrument and applicable laws and regulations. However, the Contractor's good faith administration of this clause and the effectiveness of its remedial actions and sanctions shall be positive considerations and shall be taken into account as mitigating factors in assessing the need for such actions. If DOE pursues any such action, it will inform the subject of the action of the outcome and any applicable appeal procedures.
