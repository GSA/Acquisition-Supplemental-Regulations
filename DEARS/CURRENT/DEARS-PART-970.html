         <p class="p List1">(a) Management and operating contractors shall develop and maintain systems of management and quality control to discourage waste, fraud and abuse; and to ensure that components, products, and services that are provided to the Department of Energy (DOE) satisfy the contractor's obligations under the contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) As a part of the required overall management structure, the contractor must maintain management control systems which, in compliance with the requirements of the clause at 970.5203-1 -  
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Are documented and satisfactory to DOE; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Ensure that all levels of management are accountable for effective management systems and internal controls within their areas of assigned responsibility; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Cover both programmatic and administrative functions; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Provide reasonable assurance that Government resources are safeguarded against theft, fraud, waste, and unauthorized use; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Promote efficient and effective operations; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Ensure that all obligations and costs incurred are in compliance with the intended purposes and the terms and conditions of the contract; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) Properly record, manage, and report all revenues, expenditures, transactions and assets; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8) Maintain financial, statistical and other reports necessary to maintain accurate, reliable, and timely accountability and management controls; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(9) Are periodically reviewed to ensure that the systems provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system are being accomplished and that these controls are working effectively. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Management and operating contractors shall also develop and maintain a baseline program of quality assurance that will implement documented performance and quality standards, and management controls and assessment techniques to ensure components, services, and products meet DOE's, design criteria and other governing and applicable specifications. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) DOE expects all its contractors to seek to identify improvements in any aspect of performance. Management and operating contracts are very large and complex; therefore, the opportunities to identify changes in performance that will increase the effectiveness or efficiency of contract performance are more prevalent than under other contracts. The clause at 970.5203-2 requires DOE management and operating contractors to affirmatively seek to identify, evaluate, and institute, where appropriate, processes that will improve the effectiveness or efficiency of any aspect of contract performance. It further requires the contractor to communicate any such improvements to DOE, other management and operating contractors, and DOE major facilities contractors. The contractor is required to participate in efforts by those contractors to address common problems or the institution of improvements. It allows the contractor to enlist the aid of the DOE contracting officer where necessary to institute or communicate the improvements. The obligations under the clause in no way affect the contractor's obligations under other provisions of the contract to notify or acquire the approval of the contracting officer.

The Office of Federal Procurement Policy's Seven Steps to Performance-Based Acquisition located at Web site <em class="ph i">http://www.acquisition.gov/comp/seven_steps/home.html</em> provides guidance concerning the development and use of performance-based contracting concepts and methodologies that may be generally applied to management and operating contracts. Performance-based contracts: Describe performance requirements in terms of results rather than methods of accomplishing the work; use measurable (i.e., terms of quality, timeliness, quantity) performance standards and objectives and quality assurance surveillance plans; provide performance incentives (positive or negative) where appropriate; and specify procedures for award or incentive fee reduction when work activities are not performed or do not meet contract requirements.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The use of performance-based statements of work, where feasible, is the preferred method for establishing work requirements. Such statements of work and other documents used to establish work requirements (such as work authorization directives) should describe performance requirements and expectations in terms of outcome, results, or final work products, as opposed to methods, processes, or design. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Contract performance requirements and expectations should be consistent with the Department's strategic planning goals and objectives, as made applicable to the site or facility through Departmental programmatic and financial planning processes. Measurable performance criteria, objective measures, and where appropriate, performance incentives, shall be structured to correspond to the performance requirements established in the statement of work and other documents used to establish work requirements. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Quality assurance surveillance plans shall be developed to facilitate the assessment of contractor performance and ensure the appropriateness of any award or incentive fee payment. Such plans shall be tailored to the contract performance objectives, criteria, and measures, and shall, to the maximum extent practicable, focus on the level of performance required by the performance objectives rather than the methodology used by the contractor to achieve that level of performance.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) DOE management and operating contractors may be paid a fee in accordance with the requirements of this subsection. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) There are three basic principles underlying the Department's fee policy: 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The amount of available fee should reflect the financial risk assumed by the contractor. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) It is the policy of the Department, when work elements cannot be fixed price, incentive fees (including award fees) tied to objective measures should be used to the maximum extent appropriate. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) When work elements cannot be fixed price and award fees are employed, they should be tied to either objective or subjective measures. Each measure should, to the maximum extent appropriate, be directly tied to a specific portion of the fee pool. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Fee objectives and amounts are to be determined for each contract. Standard fees or across-the-board fee agreements will not be used or made. Due to the nature of funding management and operating contracts, it is anticipated that fee shall be established in accordance with the annual funding cycle; however, with the prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, a longer period may be used where necessary to incentivize performance objectives that span funding cycles or to optimize cost reduction efforts. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Annual fee amounts shall be established in accordance with this subsection. Annual amounts shall not exceed maximum amounts derived from the appropriate fee schedule (and Classification Factor, if applicable) unless approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. In no event shall any fee exceed statutory limits imposed by 41 U.S.C. 254(b). 
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(e)
				</p><p class="p List2">(1) 
			Contracting Officers shall include negative fee incentives in contracts when appropriate. A negative fee incentive is one in which the contractor will not be paid the full target fee amount when the actual performance level falls below the target level established in the contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Negative fee incentives may only be used when -  
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) A target level of performance can be established, which the contractor can reasonably be expected to reach; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The value of the negative incentive is commensurate with the lower level of performance and any additional administrative costs; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Factors likely to prevent attainment of the target level of performance are clearly within the control of the contractor; and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) The contract indicates clearly a level below which performance is not acceptable. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Prior to the issuance of a competitive solicitation or the initiation of negotiations for an extension of an existing contract, the HCA shall coordinate the maximum available fee, as allowed by 970.1504-1-1, and the fee amount targeted for negotiation, if less, with the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. Solicitations shall identify maximum available fee under the contract and may invite offerors to propose fee less than the maximum available. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) When a contract subject to this subsection requires a contractor to use its own facilities or equipment, or other resources to make its own cost investment for contract performance, (e.g., when there is no letter-of-credit financing) consideration may be given, subject to approval by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, to increasing the total available fee amount above that otherwise provided by this subsection. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h) Multiple fee arrangements should be used in accordance with 970.1504-1-4. 
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(i)(1) In addition to other performance requirements specified in the contract, DOE management and operating contractors and other contractors designated by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, are subject to performance requirements relating to: environment, safety, and health (ES&amp;H), including worker safety and health (WS&amp;H); and safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. Performance requirements relating to ES&amp;H will be set forth in the contract's ES&amp;H terms and conditions, including a DOE approved Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS), or similar document. As applicable, performance requirements relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information will be set forth in the clauses of the contract entitled “Security” and “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives,” as well as in other terms and conditions that prescribe requirements for the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(2) If the contractor does not meet the performance requirements of the contract relating to ES&amp;H or to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information, otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings may be unilaterally reduced by the contracting officer in accordance with the clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives - Facility Management Contracts.” 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(3) The clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives - Facility Management Contracts,” provides for reductions of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings under the contract depending upon the severity of the contractor's performance failure relating to ES&amp;H requirements and, if applicable, relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. When reviewing performance failures that would otherwise warrant a potential reduction of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings, the contracting officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range specified in the clause. Some of the mitigating factors that must be considered are included in the clause.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(4) The contracting officer must obtain the concurrence of the cognizant Program Secretarial Officer 
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(i) Prior to effecting any reduction of fee or profit in accordance with the terms and conditions of the clause entitled, “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives - Facility Management Contracts;” and 
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(ii) For determinations that no reduction of fee or profit is warranted for a particular performance failure(s) that would otherwise be subject to a reduction.

         <span class="ph autonumber">970.1504-1</span>-3 Special considerations: Laboratory management and operation.</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) For the management and operation of a laboratory, the contracting officer shall consider whether any fee is appropriate. Considerations should include: 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The nature and extent of financial or other liability or risk assumed or to be assumed under the contract; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The proportion of retained earnings (as established under generally accepted accounting methods) that are utilized to fund the performance of work related to the DOE contracted effort; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Facilities capital or capital equipment acquisition plans; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Other funding needs, to include contingency funding, working capital funding, and provision for funding unreimbursed costs deemed ordinary and necessary; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) The utility of fee as a performance incentive; and 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) The need for fee to attract qualified contractors, organizations, and institutions.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) In the event fee is considered appropriate, the contracting officer shall determine the amount of fee in accordance with this subsection. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Costs incurred in the operation of a laboratory that are allowable and allocable under the cost principles (i.e., commercial using 48 CFR 31.2, nonprofit using OMB Circular A-122, or university-affiliated using OMB Circular A-21), regulations (including subpart 970.31), or statutes applicable to the operating contractor should be classified as direct or indirect (overhead or G&amp;A) charges to the contract and not included as proposed fee. Exceptions must be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Except as specified in 970.1504-1-3(c)(3), the maximum total amount of fee shall be calculated in accordance with 970.1504-1-5 or 970.1504-1-9, as appropriate. The total amount of fee under any laboratory management and operating contract or other designated contract shall not exceed, and may be significantly less than, the result of that calculation. In determining the total amount of fee, the contracting officer shall consider the evaluation of the factors in paragraph (a) of this subsection as well as any benefits the laboratory operator will receive due to its tax status. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) In the event fee is considered appropriate, the contracting officer shall establish the type of fee arrangement in accordance with this subsection. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The amount of fee may be established as total available fee with a base fee portion and a performance fee portion. Base fee, if any, shall be an amount in recognition of the risk of financial liability assumed by the contractor and shall not exceed the cost risk associated with those liabilities or the amount calculated in accordance with 970.1504-1-5, whichever is less. The total available fee, excepting any base fee, shall normally be associated with performance at or above the target level of performance as defined by the contract. If performance in either of the two general work categories appropriate for laboratories (science/technology and support) is rated at less than the target level of performance, the total amount of the available fee shall be subject to downward adjustment. Such downward adjustment shall be subject to the terms of the clause at 970.5215-3, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives - Facility Management Contracts, if contained in the contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The amount of fee may be established as a fixed fee in recognition of the risk of financial liability to be assumed by the contractor, with such fixed fee amount not exceeding the cost risk associated with the liabilities assumed or the amount of fee calculated in accordance with 970.1504-1-5, whichever is less. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) If the fixed fee or total available fee exceeds 75% of the fee that would be calculated per 970.1504-1-5 or 970.1504-1-9; or if a fee arrangement other than one of those set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) or (2) of this subsection is considered appropriate, the approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, shall be obtained prior to its use. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Fee, if any, as well as the type of fee arrangement, will normally be established for the life of the contract. It will be established at time of award, as part of the extend/compete decision, at the time of option exercise, or at such other time as the parties can mutually reach agreement, e.g., negotiations. Such agreement shall require the approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Fee established for longer than one year shall be subject to adjustment in the event of a significant change (greater than ±10% or a lessor amount if appropriate) to the budget or work scope. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Retained earnings (reserves) shall be identified and a plan for their use and disposition developed. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) The use of retained earnings as a result of performance of laboratory management and operation may be restricted if the operator is an educational institution.

         <span class="ph autonumber">970.1504-1</span>-4 Types of contracts and fee arrangements.</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Contract types and fee arrangements suitable for management and operating contracts may include cost, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, firm-fixed-price or any combination thereof (see 48 CFR subpart 16.1). In accordance with 48 CFR 970.1504-1-2(b)(1), the fee arrangement chosen for each work element should reflect the financial risk for project failure that contractors are willing to accept. Contracting officials shall structure each contract and the elements of the work in such a manner that the risk is manageable and, therefore, assumable by the contractor. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Consistent with the concept of a performance-based management contract, those contract types which incentivize performance and cost control are preferred over a cost-plus-fixed-fee arrangement. Accordingly, a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract in instances other than those set forth in 970.1504-1-3(c)(2) may only be used when approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) A cost-plus-award-fee contract is generally the appropriate contract type for a management and operating contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Where work cannot be adequately defined to the point that a fixed price contract is acceptable, the attainment of acquisition objectives generally will be enhanced by using a cost-plus-award-fee contract or other incentive fee arrangement to effectively motivate the contractor to superior performance and to provide the Department with flexibility to evaluate actual performance and the conditions under which it was achieved. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The construct of fee for a cost-plus-award-fee management and operating contract is that total available fee will equal a base fee amount and a performance fee amount. The total available fee amount including the performance fee amount the contractor may earn, in whole or in part during performance, shall be established annually (or as otherwise agreed to by the parties and approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee), in an amount sufficient to motivate performance excellence. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) However, consistent with concepts of performance-based contracting, it is Departmental policy to place fee at risk based on performance. Accordingly, a base fee amount will be available only when approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, except as permitted in 970.1504-1-3(c)(1). Any base fee amount shall be fixed, expressed as a percent of the total available fee at inception of the contract, and shall not exceed that percent during the life of the contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The performance fee amount may consist of an objective fee component and a subjective fee component. Objective performance measures, when appropriately applied, provide greater incentives for superior performance than do subjective performance measures and should be used to the maximum extent appropriate. Subjective measures should be used when it is not feasible to devise effective predetermined objective measures applicable to cost, technical performance, or schedule for particular work elements. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Consistent with performance-based contracting concepts, performance objectives and measures related to performance fee should be as clearly defined as possible and, where feasible, expressed in terms of desired performance results or outcomes. Specific measures for determining performance achievement should be used. The contract should identify the amount and allocation of fee to each performance result or outcome. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Because the nature and complexity of the work performed under a management and operating contract may be varied, opportunities may exist to utilize multiple contract types and fee arrangements. Consistent with paragraph (a) of this subsection and 48 CFR subpart 16.1, the contracting officer should apply that contract type or fee arrangement most appropriate to the work component. However, multiple contract types or fee arrangements -  
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Must conform to the requirements of 48 CFR part 915 and 48 CFR parts 15 and 16, and 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Where appropriate to the type, must be supported by -  
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Negotiated costs subject to the requirements of the Truth in Negotiations Act, 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) A pre-negotiation memorandum, and 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) A plan describing how each contract type or fee arrangement will be administered. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Cost reduction incentives are addressed in the clause at 970.5215-4, Cost Reduction. This clause provides for incentives for quantifiable cost reductions associated with contractor proposed changes to a design, process, or method that has an established cost, technical, and schedule baseline, is defined, and is subject to a formal control procedure. The clause is to be included in management and operating contracts as appropriate. Proposed changes must be: Initiated by the contractor, innovative, applied to a specific project or program, and not otherwise included in an incentive under the contract. Such cost reduction incentives do not constitute fee and are not subject to statutory or regulatory fee limitations; however, they are subject to all appropriate requirements set forth in this subpart. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) Operations and field offices shall take the lead in developing and implementing the most appropriate pricing arrangement or cost reduction incentive for the requirements. Pricing arrangements which provide incentives for performance and cost control are preferred over those that do not. The operations and field offices are to ensure that the necessary resources and infrastructure exist within both the contractor's and government's organizations to prepare, evaluate, and administer the pricing arrangement or cost reduction incentive prior to its implementation.

         <span class="ph autonumber">970.1504-1</span>-5 General considerations and techniques for determining fixed fees.</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) The Department's fee policy recognizes that fee is remuneration to contractors for the entrepreneurial function of organizing and managing resources, the use of their resources (including capital resources), and, as appropriate, their assumption of the risk that some incurred costs (operating and capital) may not be reimbursed. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Use of a purely cost-based structured approach for determining fee objectives and amounts for DOE management and operating contracts is inappropriate considering the limited level of contractor cost, capital goods, and operating capital outlays for performance of such contracts. Instead of being solely cost-based, the desirable approach calls for a structure that allows evaluation of the following eight significant factors, as outlined in order of importance, and the assignment of appropriate fee values (subject to the limitations on fixed fee in 970.1504-1-6) -  
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The presence or absence of financial risk, including the type and terms of the contract; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The relative difficulty of work, including specific performance objectives, environment, safety and health concerns, and the technical and administrative knowledge, and skill necessary for work accomplishment and experience; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Management risk relating to performance, including -  
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Composite risk and complexity of principal work tasks required to do the job; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Labor intensity of the job; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Special control problems; and 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Advance planning, forecasting and other such requirements; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Degree and amount of contract work required to be performed by and with the contractor's own resources, as compared to the nature and degree of subcontracting and the relative complexity of subcontracted efforts, subcontractor management and integration; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Size and operation (number of locations, plants, differing operations, etc.); 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Influence of alternative investment opportunities available to the contractor (i.e., the extent to which undertaking a task for the Government displaces a contractor's opportunity to make a profit with the same staff and equipment in some other field of activity); 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) Benefits which may accrue to the contractor from gaining experience and knowledge of how to do something, from establishing or enhancing a reputation, or from having the opportunity to hold or expand a staff whose loyalties are primarily to the contractor; and 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8) Other special considerations, including support of Government programs such as those relating to small and minority business subcontracting, energy conservation, etc. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The total fee objective for a particular annual fixed fee negotiation is established by evaluating the factors in this subsection, assigning fee values to them, and totaling the resulting amounts (subject to limitations on total fixed fee in 48 CFR 970.1504-1-6).

Architect-engineer and construction services are normally covered by special agreements based on the policies applying to architect-engineer or construction contracts. Fees paid for such services shall be calculated using the provisions of 915.404-4-71-5 relating to architect-engineer or construction fees and shall be in addition to the operating fees calculated for the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Special equipment is sometimes procured in conjunction with management and operating contracts. When a contractor procures special equipment, the DOE negotiating official shall determine separate fees for the equipment which shall not exceed the maximum fee allowable as established using the schedule in 915.404-4-71-5(h). 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) In determining appropriate fees, factors such as complexity of equipment, ratio of procurement transactions to volume of equipment to be purchased and completeness of services should be considered. Where possible, the reasonableness of the fees should be checked by their relationship to actual costs of comparable procurement services. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) For purposes of this subsection, special equipment is equipment for which the purchase price is of such a magnitude compared to the cost of installation as to distort the amount of technical direction and management effort required of the contractor. Special equipment is of a nature that requires less management attention. When a contractor procures special equipment, the DOE negotiating official shall determine separate fees for the equipment using the schedule in 915.404-4-71-5(h). The determination of specific items of equipment in this category requires application of judgment and careful study of the circumstances involved in each project. This category of equipment would generally include: 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Major items of prefabricated process or research equipment; and 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Major items of preassembled equipment such as packaged boilers, generators, machine tools, and large electrical equipment. In some cases, it would also include special apparatus or devices such as reactor vessels and reactor charging machines.

         <p class="p List1">(b) All annual performance incentives identified under these contracts are funded from the annual total available fee, which consists of a base fee amount (which may be zero) and a performance fee amount (which typically will consist of an incentive fee component for objective performance requirements, an award fee component for subjective performance requirements, or both). 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The annual total available fee for the contract shall equal the product of the fee(s) that would have been calculated for an annual fixed fee contract and the classification factor(s) most appropriate for the facility/task. If more than one fee schedule is applicable to the contract, the annual total available fee shall be the sum of the available fees derived proportionately from each fee schedule; consideration of significant factors applicable to each fee schedule; and application of a Classification Factor(s) most appropriate for the work.

         <p class="p P">Pursuant to Section 33 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2053), DOE is authorized to make its facilities available to other Federal and non-Federal entities (sponsors) for the conduct of certain research and development and training activities. Pursuant to the Economy Act of 1932, as amended (31 U.S.C. 1535), or other applicable authority, other Federal entities may request DOE to conduct work. DOE has implemented these and other statutory authorities and requirements in its Strategic Partnership Projects Program. DOE's internal procedures governing the Strategic Partnership Projects Program are described in DOE Order 481.1C, DOE Order 481.1C, Strategic Partnership Projects (Formerly Known as Work for Others (Non-Department of Energy Funded Work)), or successor version.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) The extent of Government ownership of the nation's energy plant and materials, and the overriding concerns of national defense and security, impose special conditions on personnel and labor relations in the energy program. Such special conditions include the need for continuity of vital operations at DOE installations; retention by DOE of absolute authority on all questions of security; and DOE review of labor expenses under management and operating contracts as a part of its responsibility for assuring judicious expenditure of public funds. It is the intent of DOE that personnel and labor policies throughout the energy program reflect the best experience of American industry in aiming to achieve the type of stable labor-management relations that are essential to the proper development of the energy program. The following enunciates the principles upon which the DOE policy is based: 
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Employment standards.</em> 
				</p><p class="p List3">(i) 
			Management and operating contractors are expected to bring experienced, proven personnel from their private operations to staff key positions on the contract and to recruit other well-qualified personnel as needed. Such personnel should be employed and treated during employment without discrimination by reason of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin. Contractors shall be required to take affirmative action to achieve these objectives.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The Contractor must conduct a thorough review, as defined at 904.401, of an uncleared applicant's or uncleared employee's background, and test the individual for illegal drugs, as part of its determination to select that individual for a position requiring a DOE access authorization.
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) A review must -  Verify an uncleared applicant's or uncleared employee's educational background, including any high school diploma obtained within the past five years, and degrees or diplomas granted by an institution of higher learning; contact listed employers for the last three years and listed personal references; conduct local law enforcement checks when such checks are not prohibited by state or local law or regulation and when the uncleared applicant or uncleared employee resides in the jurisdiction where the contractor is located; and conduct a credit check and other checks as appropriate.
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Contractor reviews are not required for an applicant for DOE access authorization who possesses a current access authorization from DOE or another federal agency, or whose access authorization may be reapproved without a federal background investigation pursuant to Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information (August 4, 1995), Sections 3.3(c) and (d).
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) In collecting and using this information to make a determination as to whether it is appropriate to select an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee for a position requiring an access authorization, the contractor must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders, including those - 
</p>
         <p class="p List5">(1) Governing the processing and privacy of an individual's information by employers, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; and
</p>
         <p class="p List5">(2) Prohibiting discrimination in employment, such as under the ADA, Title VII and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, including with respect to pre- and post-offer of employment disability related questioning.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) In addition to a review, each candidate for a DOE access authorization must be tested to demonstrate the absence of any illegal drug, as defined in 10 CFR 707.4. All positions requiring access authorizations are deemed <em class="ph i">testing designated positions</em> in accordance with 10 CFR part 707. All employees possessing access authorizations are subject to applicant, random or for cause testing for use of illegal drugs. DOE will not process candidates for a DOE access authorization unless their tests confirm the absence of any illegal drug.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) When an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee is hired specifically for a position that requires a DOE access authorization, the contractor shall not place that individual in that position prior to the access authorization being granted by DOE, unless an approval has been obtained from the contracting officer, acting in consultation for these purposes with the head of the cognizant local security office. If an uncleared employee is placed in that position prior to an access authorization being granted by the contracting officer, the uncleared employee may not be afforded access to classified information or matter or special nuclear material (in categories requiring access authorization) until the contracting officer notifies the employer that an access authorization has been granted.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List3">(v)
				</p><p class="p List4">(A) 
			The contractor must furnish to the head of the cognizant local DOE Security Office, in writing, the following information concerning each uncleared applicant or uncleared employee who is selected for a position requiring an access authorization - 
</p>
         <p class="p List5">(1) The date(s) each review was conducted;
</p>
         <p class="p List5">(2) Each entity contacted that provided information concerning the individual;
</p>
         <p class="p List5">(3) A certification that the review was conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders, including those governing the processing and privacy of an individual's information collected during the review;
</p>
         <p class="p List5">(4) A certification that all information collected during the review was reviewed and evaluated in accordance with the contractor's personnel policies; and
</p>
         <p class="p List5">(5) The results of the test for illegal drugs.
</p>
         <p class="p P">When a DOE access authorization will be required, the aforementioned review must be conducted and the required information forwarded to DOE before a request is made to DOE to process the individual for an access authorization.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(vi) Management and operating contractors and other contractors operating DOE facilities shall include the requirements set forth in this subsection in subcontracts (appropriately modified to identify the parties) wherein subcontract employees will be required to hold DOE access authorizations in order to perform on-site duties, such as protective force operations.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(2) <em class="ph i">Security.</em> On all matters of security at its facilities, DOE retains absolute authority and neither the regulations and policies pertaining to security, nor their administration, are matters for collective bargaining between the contractor's management and labor. Insofar as DOE security regulations affect the collective bargaining process, the security policies and regulations will be made known to both parties. To the fullest extent feasible, DOE will consult with representatives of the contractor's management and labor when formulating security regulations and policies that may affect the collective bargaining process. 
</p>
         <p class="p P Runin">(3) <em class="ph i">Wages, salaries, and employee benefits.</em> (i) Wages, salaries, and employee benefits shall be administered in a manner designated to adapt the normal practices and conditions of industry or institutions of higher education to the contract work, and to provide for appropriate review by DOE. Area practices, valid patterns, and well-established commercial or academic practices of the contractors, as appropriate, form the criteria for the establishment and adjustment of compensation schedules. 
</p>
         <p class="p P">(ii) The aspects of wages, hours, and working conditions which are the substance of collective bargaining in normal organized industries will be left to the orderly processes of negotiation and agreement between DOE contractor management and employee representatives with maximum possible freedom from Government interference. 
</p>
         <p class="p P">(4) <em class="ph i">Employee relations.</em> The handling of employee relations on contract work, including such matters as the conduct and discipline of the work force and the handling of employee grievances, is part of the normal management responsibility of the contractor. 
</p>
         <p class="p P Runin">(5) <em class="ph i">Collective bargaining.</em> (i) DOE review of collective bargaining practices will be premised on the view that management's trusteeship for the operation of the Government facilities includes the duty to adopt practices which are fundamental to the friendly adjustment of disputes, and which experience has shown, promote orderly collective bargaining relationships. Practices inconsistent with this view may be objected to if not found to be otherwise clearly warranted. 
</p>
         <p class="p P">(ii) Consistent with the policy of assuring continuity of operation of vital facilities, all collective bargaining agreements at DOE-owned facilities should provide that grievances and disputes involving the interpretation or application of the agreement will be settled without resorting to strike, lockout, or other interruption of normal operations. For this purpose, each collective bargaining agreement entered into during the period of performance of this contract should provide an effective grievance procedure with arbitration as its final step, unless the parties mutually agree upon some other method of assuring continuity of operation for the term of the collective bargaining agreement. 
</p>
         <p class="p P">(iii) DOE expects its management and operating contractors and the unions representing the contractor's employees to cooperate fully with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. 
</p>
         <p class="p P">(6) <em class="ph i">Personnel training.</em> DOE encourages and supports personnel training programs aimed at improving work efficiency or developing needed skills which are not otherwise obtainable. 
</p>
         <p class="p P">(7) <em class="ph i">Working conditions.</em> Accident, fire, health, and occupational hazards associated with DOE activities will be held to a practical minimum level and controlled in the interest of maintenance of health and prevention of accidents. Subject to DOE control, contractors shall be required to maintain comprehensive continuous preventive and protective programs appropriate to the particular activities throughout all operations. Appropriate financial protection in case of occupational disability must be provided to employees on DOE projects. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Title to payroll and associated records under certain contracts for the management and operation of DOE facilities, and for necessary miscellaneous construction incidental to the function of these facilities, shall vest in the Government. Such records are to be disposed of in accordance with DOE directions. For such contracts, the Solicitor of Labor has granted a tolerance from the Department of Labor Regulations to omit from the prescribed labor clauses the requirement for the retention of payrolls and associated records for a period of three years after completion of the contract. Under this tolerance, the records retention requirements for all labor clauses in the contract and the Fair Labor Standards Act are satisfied by disposal of such records in accordance with applicable DOE directives.

         <span class="ph autonumber">970.2204-1</span>-1 Administrative controls and criteria for application of the Davis-Bacon Act in operational or maintenance activities.</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Particular work items falling within one or more of the following criteria normally will be classified as non-covered by the Davis-Bacon Act, hereinafter referred to in this section as the “Act.” 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Individual work items estimated to cost $2,000 or less. The total dollar amount of the management and operating contract is not a factor to be considered and bears no relation to individual work items classified as construction, alteration and/or repair, including painting and decorating. However, no item of work, the cost of which is estimated to be in excess of $2,000, shall be artificially divided into portions less than $2,000 for the purpose of avoiding the application of the Act. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Work and services that are a part of operational and maintenance activities or which, being very closely and directly involved therewith, are more in the nature of operational activities than construction, alteration, and/or repair work. This includes work and services which would involve a material risk to continuity of operations, to life or property, or to DOE operating requirements, if performed by persons other than the contractor's regular production and maintenance forces. However, any decision that contracts or work items are non-covered for these reasons must be made by the Head of the Contracting Activity without power of delegation. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Assembly, modification, setup, installation, replacement, removal, rearrangement, connection, testing, adjustment, and calibration of machinery and equipment. However, it is noted that these activities are covered if they are part of, or would be a logical part of, the construction of a facility, or if construction-type work which is not “incidental” to the overall effort is involved. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Experimental development of equipment, processes, or devices, including assembly, fitting, installation, testing, reworking, and disassembly. This refers to equipment, processes, and devices which are assembled for the purpose of conducting a test or experiment. The design may be only conceptual in character, and professional personnel who are responsible for the experiment participate in the assembly. Specifically excluded from the category of experimental development are buildings and building utility services, as distinguished from temporary connections thereto. Also specifically excluded from this category is equipment to be used for continuous testing (e.g., a machine to be continuously used for testing the tensile strength of structural members). 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Experimental work in connection with peaceful uses of nuclear energy. This refers to equipment, processes and devices which are assembled and/or set in place and interconnected for the purpose of conducting a test or experiment. The nature of the test or experiment is such that professional personnel who are responsible for the test or experiment and/or data to be derived therefrom must, by necessity, participate in the assembly and interconnections. Specifically excluded from experimental work are buildings, building utility services, structural changes, drilling, tunneling, excavation, and back-filling work which can be performed according to customary drawings and specifications, and utility services of modifications to utility services, as distinguished from temporary connections thereto. Work in this category may be performed in mines or in other locations specifically constructed for tests or experiments. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Emergency work to combat the effects of fire, flood, earthquake, equipment failure, accident, or other casualties, and to restart the operational activity following the casualty. Work which is not directly related to restarting the activity or which involves rebuilding or replacement of a structure, structural components, or equipment is excluded from this category. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) Decontamination, including washing, scrubbing, and scraping to remove contamination; removal of contaminated soil or other material; and painting or other resurfacing, provided that such painting or resurfacing is an integral part of the decontamination activity and performed by the employees of the contractors performing the decontamination. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8) Burial of contaminated soil waste or contained liquid; however, initial preparatory work readying the burial ground for use (e.g., any grading or excavating that is a part of initial site preparation, fencing, drilling wells for continued monitoring of contamination, construction of guard or other office space) is covered. Work performed subsequent to burial which involves the placement of concrete or other like activity is also covered. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The classification of a contract as a contract for operational or maintenance activities does not necessarily mean that all work and activities at the contract location are classifiable as outside coverage of the Act since it may be necessary to separate work which should be classified as covered. Therefore, the Heads of Contracting Activities shall establish and maintain controls for the careful scrutiny of proposed work assignments under such contracts to assure that: 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Contractors whose contracts do not contemplate the performance of work covered by the Act with the contractor's own forces are neither asked nor authorized to perform work within the scope of the Act. If the actual work assignments do involve covered work, the contract should be modified to include applicable provisions of the Act. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Where covered work is performed by a contractor whose contract contains provisions required by the Act, such work is performed as required by law and the contract. After the contractor has been informed, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this subsection, that certain work is covered, the responsibilities of the Head of the Contracting Activity to assure compliance is the same as it would be if the work were being performed under a separate construction contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Controls provided for above include consideration by the Head of the Contracting Activity and the contractor, before work is begun or contracted out, of the relation of the Act to the annual programming of work; the contractor's work orders; and work contracted out in excess of $2,000. The Head of the Contracting Activity may, if consistent with DOE's responsibilities as described in this subsection, prescribe from time to time classes of work as to which applicability or nonapplicability of the Act is clear, for which the Head of the Contracting Activity will require no further DOE determination on coverage in advance of the work. For all work, controls to be established by the Head of the Contracting Activity should provide for notification to the contractor before work is begun as to whether such work is covered. The Head of the Contracting Activity is responsible for submitting to the Wage and Hours Division, Employment Standards Administration, Department of Labor, Washington, D.C. 20210, all DOE requests for project area or installation wage determinations, or individual determinations, or extensions or modification thereto. Requests for such determinations shall be made on Standard Form 308, at least 30 calendar days before they are required for use in advertising for bids or requests for proposals. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Experimental installations.</em> Within DOE programs, a variety of experiments are conducted involving materials, fuels, coolants, and processing equipment. Certain types of situations where tests and experiments have presented coverage questions are described as follows: 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Set-ups of device and/or processes.</em> The proving out of investigative findings and theories of a scientific and technical nature may require the set-up of various devices and/or processes at an early, pre-prototype stage of development. These may range from laboratory bench size to much larger set-ups. As a rule, these set-ups are made within established facilities (normally laboratories), required utility connections are made to services provided as a part of the basic facilities, and the activity as a whole falls within the functional purpose of the facility. Such set-ups are generally not covered. However, the erection of structures which are public works is covered if construction type work, other than incidental work, is involved. Preparatory work for the set-up requiring structural changes or modifications of basic utility services, as distinguished from connections thereto, is covered. The following are illustrations of non-covered set-ups of devices and/or processes: 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Assembly of piping and equipment within existing “hot cell” facilities for proving out a conceptual design of a chemical processing unit. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Assembly of equipment, including adaptation and modification thereof, in existing “hot cell” facilities to prove out a conceptual design for remotely controlled machining equipment. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Assembly of the first graphite pile in a stadium at Stagg Field in Chicago. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Assembly of materials and equipment for particular aspects of the direct current thermonuclear experiments to explore feasibility and to study other ramifications of the concept of high energy injection and to collect data thereon. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Loops.</em> Many experiments are carried on in equipment assemblies, called loops, in which liquids or gases are circulated under monitored and controlled conditions. For purposes of determining coverage under the Act, loops may be classed as loop facilities or as loop set-ups. Both of these classes of loops can include in-reactor loops and out-of-reactor loops. In differentiating between clearly identified loop set-ups and loop facilities, an area exists in which there have been some questions of coverage, such as certain loops at the Material Test Reactor and at Engineering Test Reactor and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory site. Upon clarification of this area, further illustrations will be added. In the meantime, the differentiation between loop set-ups and loop facilities must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the total criteria set forth in this subpart. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Loop set-ups.</em> The assembly, erection, modification, and disassembly of a loop set-up is non-covered. A noncontroversial example of a loop set-up is one which is assembled in a laboratory, e.g., Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, or Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, for a particular test and thereafter disassembled. However, preparatory work for a loop set-up requiring structural changes or modifications of basic utility services as distinguished from connections thereto is covered, as are material and equipment that are installed for a loop set-up which is a permanent part of the facility or which is use for a succession of experimental programs. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Loop facilities.</em> A loop facility differs from a loop set-up in that it is of a more permanent character. It is usually, but not always, of greater size. It normally involves the building or modification of a structure. Sometimes it is installed as a part of construction of the facility. It may be designed for use in a succession of experimental programs over a longer period of time. Examples of loop facilities are the in-reactor “K” loops at Hanford and the large Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion loop at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory site. The on-site assembly and erection of such loop facilities are covered. However, once a loop facility is completed and becomes operational, the criteria set forth in this paragraph for operational and maintenance activities apply. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Reactor component experiments.</em> Other experiments are carried on by insertion of experimental components within reactor systems without the use of a loop assembly. An example of reactor facilities erected for such experimental purposes are the special power excursion test reactors (SPETRs) at the National Reactor Test Site which are designed for studying reactor behavior and performance characteristics of certain reactor components. Such a facility may consist of a reactor vessel, pressurizing tank, coolant loops, pumps, heat exchangers, and other auxiliary equipment as needed. The facility also may include sufficient shielding to permit work on the reactor to proceed following a short period of power interruption, and buildings as needed to house the reactor and its auxiliary equipment. The erection and on-site assembly of such a reactor facility is covered, but the components whose characteristics are under study are excluded from coverage. To illustrate, one of the SPETRs planned for studies of nuclear reactor safety is designed to accommodate various internal fuel and control assemblies. The internal structure of the pressure vessel is designed so that cores of different shapes and sizes may be placed in the vessel for investigation, or the entire internal structure may be easily removed and replaced by a structure which will accept a different core design. Similarly, the control rod assembly is arranged to provide for flexibility in the removal of instrument leads and experimental assemblies from within the core. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Tests or experiments in peaceful uses of nuclear energy.</em> These tests or experiments are varied in nature and some are only in a planning stage. They consist of one or more nuclear or nonnuclear detonations for the purposes of acquiring data. The data can include seismic effects, radiation effects, amount of heat generated, amount of material moved and so forth. Some of these tests are conducted in existing mines, while others are conducted in facilities specifically constructed for the tests or experiments. In general, all work which can be performed in accordance with customary drawings and specifications, as well as other work in connection with preparation of facilities is treated as covered work. Such work includes tunneling, drilling, excavation and back-filling, erection of buildings or other structures, and installation of utilities. The installation of the nonnuclear material or nuclear device to be detonated, and the instrumentation and connection between such material or device and the instrumentation are treated as non-covered work. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) <em class="ph i">Tests or experiments in military uses of nuclear energy.</em> As in 970.2204-1-1(c)(4), these tests or experiments can be varied in nature. However, under this category it is intended to include only detonation of nonnuclear material or nuclear devices. The material or devices can be detonated either underground, at ground level, or above the ground. These tests or experiments have been conducted in, on, or in connection with facilities specifically constructed for such tests or experiments. As in tests or experiments in peaceful uses of nuclear energy, all work which can be performed in accord with customary drawings and specifications, as well as other work in connection with preparation of facilities are treated as covered work. Such work includes building towers or similar structures, tunneling, drilling, excavation and backfilling, erection of buildings or other structures, and installation of utilities. The installation of the nonnuclear material or nuclear devices and instrumentation are treated as non-covered work. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Construction site contiguous to an established manufacturing facility.</em> As DOE-owned property sometimes encompasses several thousand acres of real estate, a number of separate facilities may be located in areas contiguous to each other on the same property. These facilities may be built over a period of years, and established manufacturing activities may be regularly carried on at one site at the same time that construction of another facility is underway at another site. On occasion, the regular manufacturing activities of the operating contractor at the first site may include the manufacture, assembly, and reconditioning of components and equipment which in other industries would normally be done in established commercial plants. While the manufacture of components and equipment in the manufacturing plant is non-covered, the installation of any such manufactured items on a construction job is covered.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) DOE sites and facilities are managed and operated on behalf of the Department of Energy by a contractor, pursuant to management and operating contracts that are generally awarded for a five (5) year term, with the possibility for renewal. Special provisions relating to patent rights are appropriately incorporated into an M&amp;O contract because of the unique circumstances and responsibilities of managing and operating a Government-owned facility, as compared to other federally funded research and development contracts. 
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(b)
				</p><p class="p List2">(1) 
			<em class="ph i">Technology transfer mission clause.</em> In accordance with Public Law 101-189, section 3133(d), DOE may grant technology transfer authority to M&amp;O contractors operating a DOE facility. Generally, M&amp;O contractors have the right to elect to retain title to inventions made under the contract, whether a nonprofit or educational organizations, as a result of 35 U.S.C. 200 <em class="ph i">et seq.</em> (Bayh-Dole Act), or a large business, as a result of a class patent waiver issued pursuant to 10 CFR part 784. Under such contracts, the M&amp;O contractor assumes responsibilities for commercializing retained inventions, in accordance with the Technology Transfer Mission clause provided at 970.5227-3. That clause also governs such activities as the distribution of royalties earned from inventions made under the contract and the transfer of patent rights in inventions made under the contract to successor contractors. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If the M&amp;O contractor is a nonprofit organization or small business firm having technology transfer authority, the following clauses are inserted into the M&amp;O contract: 970.5227-3 and 970.5227-10. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) If the M&amp;O contract has technology transfer as a mission and is to be performed by a for-profit, large business firm that has been granted an advance class waiver, the following clauses are inserted into the M&amp;O contract: 970.5227-3 and 970.5227-12. The terms of the clause at 970.5227-12 are subject to modification to conform to the terms of the class waiver. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) If the M&amp;O contract does not have a technology transfer mission and is to be performed by a for-profit, large business firm and does not have advance class waiver under 10 CFR part 784, the patent rights clause at 970.5227-11 is inserted into the M&amp;O contract, and the Technology Transfer Mission clause is inapplicable. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) If the contractor is an educational institution, a non-profit organization or a small business firm and is conducting privately funded technology transfer activities, involving the use of private funds to conduct licensing and marketing activities related to inventions made under the contract in accordance with the Bayh-Dole Act, DOE may modify the patent rights clause (970.5227-10) to address issues such as the disposition of royalties earned under the privately funded technology transfer program, the transfer of patent rights to a successor contractor, allowable cost restrictions concerning privately funded technology transfer activities, and the Government's freedom from any liability related to licensing under the contractor's privately funded technology transfer program. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Contracting officers must consult with DOE patent counsel assisting the contracting activity or the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property for assistance in selecting for use in the solicitation, negotiating, or approving appropriate patent rights clauses for a M&amp;O contract. It may be appropriate to include more than one patent rights clause in a solicitation if the successful contractor could, for instance, be either an educational or a large business. If a large business may be selected for performance of a contract that will include a technology transfer clause, the solicitation must include the clause at 970.5227-12 to reflect the waiver that will likely be granted. If the solicitation includes more than one patent clause, it must include an explanation of the circumstances under which the appropriate clause will be used. The final award must contain only one patent rights clause.

			The patent rights clause provided at 970.5227-11 must be incorporated into the M&amp;O contract if the contractor is a for-profit, large business firm and the contract does not have a technology transfer mission or if, without regard to the type of contractor, the contract is for the operation of a DOE facility primarily dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs. That clause provides for DOE's statutory obligation to take title to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under an M&amp;O contract, and does not contemplate an advance class waiver of Government rights in inventions, or participation by the contractor in technology transfer activities. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) While only in rare circumstances does a for-profit large business contractor whose contract contains no technology transfer mission receive rights in or title to inventions made under the contract, the contractor does have the right to request a license or foreign patent rights in inventions made under the contract, and may petition for a waiver of Government rights in identified inventions. The patent rights clause 970.5227-11 does not include many of the provisions of patent rights clauses 970.5227-10 and 970.5227-12, related to the filing of patent applications by the contractor, the granting of rights in inventions by the contractor to third parties (preference for United States industry), and conditions allowing the Government to grant licenses to third parties in inventions retained by the contractor (march-in rights). Any instrument granting rights in inventions made under a contract governed by patent rights clause 970.5227-11 must include these additional provisions within its terms and conditions. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Allocation of Principal Rights: Contractor right to elect title under an advance class waiver.</em> If the M&amp;O contractor is a for-profit, large business firm and the Government has granted an advance class waiver of Government rights in inventions made in the course of or under the M&amp;O contract, under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2182) and the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5908(c)), the patent rights clause provided at 970.5227-12 must be inserted into the M&amp;O contract, unless the terms and conditions of such an approved waiver alter or replace the patent rights clause provisions pursuant to 10 CFR part 784. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Extensions of time - DOE discretion.</em> The patent rights clauses for M&amp;O contracts require the contractor to take certain actions within prescribed time periods to comply with the contract and preserve its rights in inventions. The M&amp;O contractor may request extensions of time in which to take such actions by submitting written justification to DOE, and DOE may grant the contractor's requests, on a case-by-case basis. If the time period expired due to negligence by the contractor, DOE may grant a request for an extension of time upon a showing by the contractor that corrective procedures are in place to avoid such negligence in the future. If a contractor is requesting an extension of time in which to elect to retain title to an invention, DOE may grant the request if the extension allows the contractor to conduct further experimentation, market research, or other analysis helpful to determine contractor interest in electing title to the invention, among other considerations. Generally, the extensions of time are for periods of between six (6) months to one 
				</p><p class="p List2">(1) 
			year. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Facilities license.</em> These include the rights to make, use, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all articles, materials, products, or processes embodying inventions or discoveries used or embodied in the facility regardless of whether or not conceived or first actually reduced to practice under or in the course of such a contract. The patent rights clauses, 970.5227-10, 970.5227-11, 970.5227-12, each contain a provision granting the Government this facilities license. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Deletion of classified inventions provision.</em> If DOE determines that the research, development, demonstration or production work to be performed during the course of a management and operating contract most probably will not involve classified subject matter or result in any inventions that require security classification, DOE patent counsel may advise the contracting officer to delete the patent rights clause provision entitled, “Classified Inventions” from the M&amp;O contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) <em class="ph i">Alternate 1 - Weapons Related Research or Production.</em> If DOE grants technology transfer authority to a DOE facility, pursuant to Public Law 101-189, section 3133(d), and the DOE owned facility is involved in weapons related research and development, or production, then Alternate 1 of the patent rights clauses must be inserted into the M&amp;O contract. Alternate 1 defines weapons related subject inventions and restricts the contractor's rights with respect to such inventions.

         <p class="p List1">(a) Rights in data relating to the performance of the contract and to all facilities are significant in assuring continuity of the management and operation of DOE facilities. It is crucial in assuring DOE's continuing ability to perform its statutory missions that DOE obtain rights to all data produced or specifically used by its management and operating contractors and appropriate subcontractors. In order to obtain the necessary rights in technical data, DOE contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contracts contain either the Rights in Data clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data - Facilities, or the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data - Technology Transfer. Selection of the appropriate clause is dependent upon whether technology transfer is a mission of the management and operating contract pursuant to the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, Public Law 101-189, (15 U.S.C. 3711 <em class="ph i">et seq.,</em> as amended). If technology transfer is not a mission of the management and operating contract, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data - Facilities, shall be used. In those instances in which technology transfer is a mission of the contract, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data - Technology Transfer, shall be used. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Employees of the management and operating contractor may not be used to assist in the preparation of a proposal or bid for services which are similar or related to those being performed under the contract, which are to be performed by the contractor or its parent or affiliate organization for commercial customers unless the employee has been separated from work under the DOE contract for such period as the Head of the Contracting Activity or designee shall have directed.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) The clauses at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data-Facilities, and 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data - Technology Transfer, both provide generally for Government ownership and for unlimited rights in the Government for all data first produced in the performance of the contract and unlimited rights in data specifically used in the performance of the contract. Both clauses provide that, subject to patent, security, and other provisions of the contract, the contractor may use contract data for its private purposes. The contractor, under either clause, must treat any data furnished by DOE or acquired from other Government agencies or private entities in the performance of their contracts in accordance with any restrictive legends contained therein. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Since both clauses secure access to and, if requested, delivery of technical data used in the performance of the contract, there is generally no need to use the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 in the management and operating contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(c)
				</p><p class="p List2">(1) 
			Paragraph (d) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data - Facilities, and paragraph (f) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data - Technology Transfer, provide for the inclusion in subcontracts of the Rights in Technical Data - General clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, with Alternate V, and modified in accordance with DEAR 927.409. Those clauses also provide for the inclusion in appropriate subcontracts Alternates II, III, and IV to the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14 with DOE's prior approval and the inclusion of the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 in all subcontracts for research, development, or demonstration and all other subcontracts having special requirements for the production or delivery of data. In subcontracts, including subcontracts for related support services, involving the design or operation of any plants or facilities or specially designed equipment for such plants or facilities that are managed or operated by the contractor under its contract with DOE, the management and operating contractor shall use the Rights in Data - Facilities clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Where, however, a subcontract is to be awarded by the management and operating contractor in connection with a program, as discussed at 927.404-70, which provides statutory authority to protect from public disclosure, data first produced under contracts awarded pursuant to the program, contracting officers shall ensure that the management and operating contractor includes in that subcontract the rights in data clause provided by DOE Patent Counsel, consistent with any accompanying guidance. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Management and operating contractors and higher-tier subcontractors shall not use their power to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software for their private use, nor may they acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software except through the use of Alternate II or III to the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, respectively, without the prior approval of DOE Patent Counsel. 
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(d)
				</p><p class="p List2">(1) 
			Paragraphs (e) and (f) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data - Facilities, and paragraphs (g) and (h) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data - Technology Transfer, provide for the contractor's granting a nonexclusive license in any limited rights data and restricted computer software specifically used in performance of the contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) In certain instances the objectives of DOE would be frustrated if the Government did not obtain, at the time of contracting, limited license rights on behalf of responsible third parties and the Government, and to limited rights data or restricted computer software or both necessary for the practice of subject inventions or data first produced or delivered in the performance of the contract. This situation may arise in the performance of management and operating contracts and contracts for the management or operation of a DOE facility or site. Contracting officers should consult with program officials and Patent Counsel. No such rights should be obtained from a small business or non-profit organization, unless similar rights in background inventions of the small business or non-profit organization have been authorized in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(f). Where such a background license is in DOE's interest, a provision that provides substantially as Alternate VI at 48 CFR 952.227-14 should be added to the appropriate clause, 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data - Facilities, or 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data - Technology Transfer. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) The Rights in Data - Technology Transfer clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2 differs from the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data - Facilities, in the context of its more detailed treatment of copyright. In management and operating contracts that have technology transfer as a mission, the right to assert copyright in data first produced under the contract will be a valuable right, and commercialization of such data, including computer software, will assist the management and operating contractor in advancing the technology transfer mission of the contract. The clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data - Technology Transfer, provides for DOE approval of DOE's taking a limited copyright license for a period of five years, and, in certain rare cases, specified longer periods in order to contribute to commercialization of the data. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Contracting officers should consult with Patent Counsel to assure that requirements regarding royalties and conflicts of interest associated with asserting copyright in data first produced under the contract are appropriately addressed in the Technology Transfer Mission clause (48 CFR 970.5227-3) of the management and operating contract. Where it is not otherwise clear which DOE program funded the development of a computer software package, such as where the development was funded out of a contractor's overhead account, the DOE program which was the primary source of funding for the entire contract is deemed to have administrative responsibility. This issue may arise, among others, in the decision whether to grant the contractor permission to assert copyright. See paragraph (e) of the Rights in Data - Technology Transfer clause at 970.5227-2. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) In management and operating contracts involving access to DOE-owned Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, DOE has reserved the right to receive reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions and discoveries, including its related restricted data and technology. Alternate I to each clause shall be used where access to Category C-24 restricted data is contemplated in the performance of a contract.

In implementing the NCTTA, DOE has negotiated technology transfer clauses with the contractors managing and operating its laboratories. Those technology transfer clauses must be read in concert with the patent rights clause required by this subpart.

         <span class="ph autonumber">970.3102-3</span>-70 Home office expenses.</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) For on-site work, DOE's fee for management and operating contracts, determined under the policy of and calculated per the procedures in 970.1504-1-3, generally provides adequate compensation for home or corporate office general and administrative expenses incurred in the general management of the contractor's business as a whole. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) DOE recognizes that some Home Office Expenses are incurred for the benefit of a management and operating contract. DOE has elected to recognize that benefit through fee due to the difficulty of determining the dollar value applicable to any management and operating contract. The difficulty arises because: 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The general construct of a management and operating contract results in minimal Home Office involvement in the contract work, and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Conventional Home Office Expense allocation techniques that use bases such as total operating costs, labor dollars, hours etc., are not appropriate because they inherently assume significant contractor investment (in terms of its own resources, such as, labor, material, overhead, etc.). Contractor investments are minimal under DOE's operating and management contracts. The contracts are totally financed by DOE advance payments, and DOE provides government-owned facilities, property, and other needed resources. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) From time to time, the fee for a management and operating contract may not be adequate compensation for Home Office Expenses incurred for the benefit of the contract. An indication that such a case exists is the need for significant home office support to deal with issues at the site that occur without the fault or negligence of the contractor, for example, the need for home office legal support to deal with third party, environmental, safety, or health issues. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) In such a case, the contracting officer, after obtaining the HCA's approval, may consider a contractor request for additional compensation. The contractor may request -  
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Fee in addition to its normal fee (but see 970.1504-1-3(b)(1) if the contract is for the management and operation of a laboratory); or
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Compensation on the basis of actual cost. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Because the contract's fee provides some compensation for Home Office Expenses, the contractor's request for additional compensation must always be for an amount less than the Home Office Expenses that are incurred for the benefit of the management and operating contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) For off-site work, the DOE allows Home Office Expenses under architect-engineer, supply and research contracts with commercial contractors performing the work in their own facilities. Home Office Expenses may, however, be included for reimbursement under such DOE off-site architect-engineer, supply and research contracts, only to the extent that they are determined, after careful examination, to be allowable, reasonable, and properly allocable to the work. Work performed in a contractor's own facilities under a management and operating or construction contract may likewise be allowed to bear the properly allocable portion of allowable Home Office Expenses.

         <p class="p Runin List1">(a)(6) In determining the reasonableness of compensation, the compensation of each individual contractor employee normally need not be subjected to review and approval. Generally, the compensation paid individual employees should be left to the judgment of contractors subject to the limitations of DOE-approved compensation policies, programs, classification systems, and schedules, and amounts of money authorized for wage and salary increases for groups of employees. However, the contracting officer shall designate a compensation threshold appropriate for the particular situation. The contract shall specifically provide that contracting officer approval is required for compensating an individual contractor employee above the threshold if a total of 50 percent or more of such compensation is reimbursed under DOE cost-type contracts. For purposes of designating the threshold, total compensation includes only the employee's salary and cash bonus or incentive compensation.

Costs that are unallowable under other contract terms shall not be allowable as compensation for personnel services.
</p>

The contractor will advise DOE of any proposed changes in any matters covered by these policies, practices, or plans which relate to personnel costs. Types of personnel costs and related expenses addressed in the contract are as follows: Salaries and wages; bonuses and incentive compensation; overtime, shift differential, holiday, and other premium pay for time worked; welfare benefits and retirement programs; paid time off, and salaries and wages to employees in their capacity as union stewards and committeemen for time spent in handling grievances, or serving on labor management (contractor) committees provided, however, that the contracting officer's approval is required in each instance of total compensation to an individual employee above an annual rate as specified in the contract.

			“Cost of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft,” as used in this paragraph, includes the cost of lease, charter, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and other related costs. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The costs of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft are limited to the standard airfare described in paragraph (d) of this subsection for the flight destination unless travel by such aircraft is specifically required by contract specification, term, or condition, or a higher amount is approved by the contracting officer. A higher amount may be agreed to when one or more of the circumstances for justifying higher than standard airfare listed in paragraph (d) of this subsection are applicable, or when an advance agreement under paragraph (e)(3) of this subsection has been executed. In all cases, travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft must be fully documented and justified. For each contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft used for any business purpose which is charged or allocated, directly or indirectly, to a Government contract, the contractor must maintain and make available manifest/logs for all flights on such company aircraft. As a minimum, the manifest/log shall indicate -

</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) Purpose of trip. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Where an advance agreement is proposed (see 48 CFR 31.109), consideration may be given to the following: 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Whether scheduled commercial airlines or other suitable, less costly, travel facilities are available at reasonable times, with reasonable frequency, and serve the required destinations conveniently; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Whether increased flexibility in scheduling results in time savings and more effective use of personnel that would outweigh additional travel costs. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Costs of contractor-owned or -leased automobiles, as used in this paragraph, include the costs of lease, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, etc. These costs are allowable, if reasonable, to the extent that the automobiles are used for company business. That portion of the cost of company-furnished automobiles that relates to personal use by employees (including transportation to and from work) is compensation for personal services and is unallowable as stated in 48 CFR 31.205-6(m)(2).

         <p class="p List2">(3) Ensure the review of individual purchasing actions of certain types, or above stated dollar levels, by the contracting officer pursuant to 48 CFR subpart 44.2 or as set forth in the contractor's approved system and methods; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Ensure that periodic appraisals of the contractor's management of all facets of the purchasing function, including compliance with the contractor's approved system and methods, are performed by the contracting officer. Such appraisals shall be performed through either of the following methodologies -  
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Contractor Purchasing System Reviews, conducted in accordance with 48 CFR subpart 44.3; or

In establishing these thresholds, the Heads of the Contracting Activities should consider such factors as the following - 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The nature of work to be performed under the management and operating contract; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The size, experience, ability, reliability, and organization of the management and operating contractor's purchasing function;

         <p class="p List1">(c) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall take such action as may be required to insure compliance with the procedure for purchasing from contractor-affiliated sources or the purchase of specific items, or classes of items, which by the terms of the contract may require DOE approval. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) The Heads of the Contracting Activities may raise or lower the review and approval thresholds established pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection at any time. Such action may be considered upon the periodic review of the contractor's purchasing system, but in any case those adjusted thresholds may not exceed the approval authority delegated to the Head of the Contracting Activity by the Senior Procurement Executive.

         <p class="p List1">(e) DOE approvals of specific proposed purchases pursuant to this subpart shall communicate that such approval does not relieve the management and operating contractor of any obligation under its prime contract with DOE; is given without prejudice to any rights or claims of the Government thereunder; creates no obligation on the part of the Government to the subcontractor, and is not a predetermination of the allowability of costs to be incurred under the subcontract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contractors establish and maintain subcontract files which contain those documents essential to present an accurate and adequate record of all purchasing transactions. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) Contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contractors document purchases in writing, setting forth the information and data used in determining that the purchases are in the best interest of the Government. The scope and detail of this documentation shall be consistent with the nature, dollar value, and complexity of the purchase. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall assure that the contracting activity establishes and maintains files of the documents associated with the review and approval of subcontract actions subject to DOE review and approval. Those files shall include, among other necessary documentation, an appraisal of the proposed action by the contracting activity and a copy of the approving or disapproving document forwarded to the management and operating contractor, including a listing of any deficiencies, a listing of any required corrective actions, any suggestions, or other relevant comments.

Where the contract provides for financial incentives that extend beyond a single evaluation period, this amount shall also include: any provisional amounts determined otherwise payable in the evaluation period; and, if provisional payments are not provided for, the allocable amount of any incentive determined otherwise payable at the conclusion of a subsequent evaluation period. The allocable amount shall be the total amount of the earned incentive divided by the number of evaluation periods over which it was earned.

If the Government is not aware of the failure, it will effect the reduction as soon as practical after becoming aware. For any portion of the reduction requiring an allocation the Government will effect the reduction at the end of the evaluation period in which it determines the total amount earned under the incentive. If at any time a reduction causes the sum of the payments the Contractor has received for fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings to exceed the sum of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings the Contractor has earned (provisionally or otherwise), the Contractor shall immediately return the excess to the Government. (What the Contractor “has earned” reflects any reduction made under this or any other clause of the contract.)

                                    <p class="p List1">(g) The Contractor shall promptly evaluate and resolve any noncompliance with applicable ES&amp;H requirements and the System. If the Contractor fails to provide resolution or if, at any time, the Contractor's acts or failure to act causes substantial harm or an imminent danger to the environment or health and safety of employees or the public, the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping work in whole or in part. Any stop work order issued by a contracting officer under this clause (or issued by the Contractor to a subcontractor in accordance with paragraph (i) of this clause) shall be without prejudice to any other legal or contractual rights of the Government. In the event that the Contracting Officer issues a stop work order, an order authorizing the resumption of the work may be issued at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time or additional fee or damages by reason of, or in connection with, any work stoppage ordered in accordance with this clause. 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(h) Regardless of the performer of the work, the Contractor is responsible for compliance with the ES&amp;H requirements applicable to this contract.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(i) The Contractor shall include a clause substantially the same as this clause in subcontracts involving complex or hazardous work on site at a DOE-owned or -leased facility. Such subcontracts shall provide for the right to stop work under the conditions described in paragraph (g) of this clause. Depending on the complexity and hazards associated with the work, the Contractor may choose not to require the subcontractor to submit a Safety Management System for the Contractor's review and approval.</p>

</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) Contractor Request to Assert Copyright. 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) For data other than scientific and technical articles and data produced under a CRADA, the Contractor shall submit in writing to Patent Counsel its request to assert copyright in data first produced in the performance of this Contract pursuant to this clause. The right of the Contractor to copyright data first produced under a CRADA is as described in the individual CRADA. Each request by the Contractor must include: 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List4">(A) The identity of the data (including any computer program) for which the Contractor requests permission to assert copyright, as well as an abstract which is descriptive of the data and is suitable for dissemination purposes, (B) The program under which it was funded, (C) Whether, to the best knowledge of the Contractor, the data is subject to an international treaty or agreement, (D) Whether the data is subject to export control, (E) A statement that the Contractor plans to commercialize the data in compliance with the clause of this contract entitled, “Technology Transfer Mission,” within five (5) years after obtaining permission to assert copyright or, on a case-by-case basis, a specified longer period where the Contractor can demonstrate that the ability to commercialize effectively is dependent upon such longer period, and (F) For data other than computer software, a statement explaining why the assertion of copyright is necessary to enhance commercialization and is consistent with DOE's dissemination responsibilities. 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) For data that is developed using other funding sources in addition to DOE funding, the permission to assert copyright in accordance with this clause must also be obtained by the Contractor from all other funding sources prior to the Contractor's request to Patent Counsel. The request shall include the Contractor's certification or other documentation acceptable to Patent Counsel demonstrating such permission has been obtained. 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(iii) Permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in excepted categories of data as determined by DOE will be expressly withheld. Such excepted categories include data whose release

			would be detrimental to national security, i.e., involve classified information or data or sensitive information under Section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or are subject to export control for nonproliferation and other nuclear-related national security purposes, (B) would not enhance the appropriate transfer or dissemination and commercialization of such data, (C) would have a negative impact on U.S. industrial competitiveness, (D) would prevent DOE from meeting its obligations under treaties and international agreements, or (E) would be detrimental to one or more of DOE's programs. Additional excepted categories may be added by the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property. Where data are determined to be under export control restriction, the Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subject to the provisions of this clause for purposes of limited commercialization in a manner that complies with export control statutes and applicable regulations. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, all data developed with Naval Reactors' funding and those data that are classified fall within excepted categories. The rights of the Contractor in data are subject to the disposition of data rights in the treaties and international agreements identified under this Contract as well as those additional treaties and international agreements which DOE may from time to time identify by unilateral amendment to the Contract; such amendment listing added treaties and international agreements is effective only for data which is developed after the date such treaty or international agreement is added to this Contract. Also, the Contractor will not be permitted to assert copyright in data in the form of various technical reports generated by the Contractor under the Contract without first obtaining the advanced written permission of the contracting officer.

                                    <p class="p List2">(2) DOE Review and Response to Contractor's Request. The Patent Counsel shall use its best efforts to respond in writing within 90 days of receipt of a complete request by the Contractor to assert copyright in technical data and computer software pursuant to this clause. Such response shall either give or withhold DOE's permission for the Contractor to assert copyright or advise the Contractor that DOE needs additional time to respond, and the reasons therefor.

			An abstract describing the software suitable for publication, (B) the source code for each software program, and (C) the object code and at least the minimum support documentation needed by a technically competent user to understand and use the software. The Patent Counsel, for good cause shown by the Contractor, may allow the minimum support documentation to be delivered within 60 days after permission to assert copyright is given or at such time the minimum support documentation becomes available. The Contractor acknowledges that the DOE designated software distribution and control point may provide a technical description of the software in an announcement identifying its availability from the copyright holder. 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, for data other than computer software to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause above, the Contractor shall within sixty (60) days of obtaining such permission furnish to DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) a copy of such data as well as an abstract of the data suitable for dissemination purposes. The Contractor acknowledges that OSTI may provide an abstract of the data in an announcement to DOE, its contractors and to the public identifying its availability from the copyright holder. 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(iii) For a five year period or such other specified period as specifically approved by Patent Counsel beginning on the date the Contractor is given permission to assert copyright in data, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. Upon request, the initial period may be extended after DOE approval. The DOE approval will be based on the standard that the work is still commercially available and the market demand is being met. 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(iv) After the period approved by Patent Counsel for application of the limited Government license described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this clause, or if, prior to the end of such period(s), the Contractor abandons commercialization activities pertaining to the data to which the Contractor has been given permission to assert copyright, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, distribute copies to the public, prepare derivative works, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(v) Whenever the Contractor asserts copyright in data pursuant to this paragraph (e), the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 on the copyrighted data and also an acknowledgment of the Government sponsorship and license rights of paragraphs (e)(3) (iii) and (iv) of this clause. Such action shall be taken when the data are delivered to the Government, published, licensed or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. The acknowledgment of Government sponsorship and license rights shall be as follows: Notice: These data were produced by (insert name of Contractor) under Contract No. _______ with the Department of Energy. For (period approved by DOE Patent Counsel) from (date permission to assert copyright was obtained), the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. There is provision for the possible extension of the term of this license. Subsequent to that period or any extension granted, the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. The specific term of the license can be identified by inquiry made to Contractor or DOE. Neither the United States nor the United States Department of Energy, nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, express or implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any data , apparatus, product, or process disclosed, or represents that its use would not infringe privately owned rights.

				</p><p class="p List4">(A) 
			of this clause. Before licensing under this subparagraph (vi), DOE shall furnish the Contractor a written request for the Contractor to grant the stated license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days (or such longer period as may be authorized by the contracting officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor) after such notice to show cause why the license should not be granted. The Contractor shall have the right to appeal the decision of the DOE to grant the stated license to the Invention Licensing Appeal Board as set forth in 10 CFR 781.65 - ”Appeals.” 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(vii) No costs shall be allowable for maintenance of copyrighted data, primarily for the benefit of the Contractor and/or a licensee which exceeds DOE Program needs, except as expressly provided in writing by the contracting officer. The Contractor may use its net royalty income to effect such maintenance costs.

When DOE approves such reservation, the Contractor's license will normally extend to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.

This license will not be revoked in the field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the subject invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application of the subject invention in that foreign country.

                                    <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Notice of revocation of modification of a Contractor license.</em> Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781 concerning the licensing of Government owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.
