<p><a name="P3_204"></a><b>Subpart 970.01—Management and Operating Contract Regulatory System</b></p>

<p><a name="P4_272"></a><b>970.0100   Scope of part.</b></p>

<p>This part provides Departmental policies, procedures, provisions, and clauses that implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (Chapter 1 of Title 48 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)) and other parts of the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) (Chapter 9 of Title 48 CFR) for the award and administration of the Department's management and operating contracts, as defined at 48 CFR subpart 17.6. The FAR and other parts of the DEAR apply to management and operating contracts. See 970.5200 for guidance regarding which provisions and clauses (from FAR, part 970, or other parts of the DEAR) to include in management and operating contracts. </p>

<p>[65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 74 FR 36370, July 22, 2009; 75 FR 68219, Nov. 5, 2010]</p>

<p><a name="P7_1072"></a><b>970.0103   Publication and codification.</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Organization of Part 970.</i> (1) To the extent possible, the titles and text of the subparts, sections, and subsections of this part are numbered to correspond with related material that is contained in the FAR. </p>

<p>(2) The number to the left of the decimal point represents the DEAR part number (i.e., 970). The numbers to the right of the decimal point and to the left of the dash represent, in order, the DEAR subpart (first two digits), and the DEAR section number (second two digits). The numbers to the right of the dash represent the DEAR subsection. A second dash may follow the DEAR subsection number. As applicable, numbers to the right of the second dash represent subordinate subsections. </p>

<p>(3) To the extent practicable, the subpart number corresponds with the FAR part which contains related coverage, and the section number corresponds with the FAR subpart which contains related coverage (e.g., the coverage contained in 970.0309 corresponds with material contained in 48 CFR subpart 3.9). </p>

<p>(4) Where the FAR does not contain related coverage on a particular subject, the DEAR section number will be numbered using numbers of 70 and up (e.g., 970.0370). </p>

<p>(b) <i>Special Note Regarding Clause Numbering.</i> The section number for clauses prescribed in part 970 are numbered to correspond with the subpart in which the clause is prescribed (e.g., 970.5203-1 is prescribed for use at subpart 970.03). </p>

<p><a name="P16_2721"></a><b>970.0309-1   Applicability.</b></p>

<p>The contracting officer shall refer to subpart 903.9 regarding the applicability of the DOE Employee Protection Program to management and operating contracts. </p>

<p><a name="P19_2977"></a><b>970.0370   Management Controls and Improvements.</b></p>

<p><a name="P20_3025"></a><b>970.0370-1   Policy.</b></p>

<p>(a) Management and operating contractors shall develop and maintain systems of management and quality control to discourage waste, fraud and abuse; and to ensure that components, products, and services that are provided to the Department of Energy (DOE) satisfy the contractor's obligations under the contract. </p>

<p>(b) As a part of the required overall management structure, the contractor must maintain management control systems which, in compliance with the requirements of the clause at 970.5203-1— </p>

<p>(1) Are documented and satisfactory to DOE; </p>

<p>(2) Ensure that all levels of management are accountable for effective management systems and internal controls within their areas of assigned responsibility; </p>

<p>(3) Cover both programmatic and administrative functions; </p>

<p>(4) Provide reasonable assurance that Government resources are safeguarded against theft, fraud, waste, and unauthorized use; </p>

<p>(5) Promote efficient and effective operations; </p>

<p>(6) Ensure that all obligations and costs incurred are in compliance with the intended purposes and the terms and conditions of the contract; </p>

<p>(7) Properly record, manage, and report all revenues, expenditures, transactions and assets; </p>

<p>(8) Maintain financial, statistical and other reports necessary to maintain accurate, reliable, and timely accountability and management controls; and</p>

<p>(9) Are periodically reviewed to ensure that the systems provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system are being accomplished and that these controls are working effectively. </p>

<p>(c) Management and operating contractors shall also develop and maintain a baseline program of quality assurance that will implement documented performance and quality standards, and management controls and assessment techniques to ensure components, services, and products meet DOE's, design criteria and other governing and applicable specifications. </p>

<p>(d) DOE expects all its contractors to seek to identify improvements in any aspect of performance. Management and operating contracts are very large and complex; therefore, the opportunities to identify changes in performance that will increase the effectiveness or efficiency of contract performance are more prevalent than under other contracts. The clause at 970.5203-2 requires DOE management and operating contractors to affirmatively seek to identify, evaluate, and institute, where appropriate, processes that will improve the effectiveness or efficiency of any aspect of contract performance. It further requires the contractor to communicate any such improvements to DOE, other management and operating contractors, and DOE major facilities contractors. The contractor is required to participate in efforts by those contractors to address common problems or the institution of improvements. It allows the contractor to enlist the aid of the DOE contracting officer where necessary to institute or communicate the improvements.

<p><a name="P41_6785"></a><b>970.0371-2   Applicability.</b></p>

<p>The policies in this section are applicable to all DOE management and operating contractors. </p>

<p><a name="P43_6905"></a><b>970.0371-3   Definition.</b></p>

<p><i>Employees,</i> as used in this section, are defined to mean individuals employed by the contractor, both full and part-time, who are assigned to work under a DOE management and operating contract. </p>

<p><a name="P45_7122"></a><b>970.0371-4   Gratuities.</b></p>

<p>Employees of a management and operating contractor shall not, under circumstances which might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence the recipients in the conduct of their duties, accept any gratuity or special favor from individuals or organizations with whom the contractor is doing business, or proposing to do business, in accomplishing the work under the contract. Reference is made to the requirements prescribed in 48 CFR 3.502. </p>

<p><a name="P47_7596"></a><b>970.0371-5   Use of privileged information.</b></p>

<p>Management and operating contractor employees shall not use privileged information for personal gain, or make other improper use of privileged information which is acquired in connection with their employment on contract work. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “privileged information” includes but is not limited to, unpublished information relating to technological and scientific developments; medical, personnel, or security records of individuals; anticipated materials' requirements or pricing action; possible new sites for DOE program operations; internal DOE decisions; policy development; and knowledge of selections of contractors or subcontractors in advance of official announcement. </p>

<p><a name="P49_8352"></a><b>970.0371-6   Incompatibility between regular duties and private interests.</b></p>

<p>(a) Employees of a management and operating contractor shall not be permitted to make or influence any decisions on behalf of the contractor which directly or indirectly affect the interest of the Government, if the employee's personal concern in the matter may be incompatible with the interest of the Government. For example: An employee of a contractor will not negotiate, or influence the award of, a subcontract with a company in which the individual has an employment relationship or significant financial interest; and an employee of a contractor will not be assigned the preparation of an evaluation for DOE or for any DOE contractor of some technical aspect of the work of another organization with which the individual has an employment relationship, or significant financial interest, or which is a competitor of an organization (other than the contractor who is the individual's regular employer) in which the individual has an employment relationship or significant financial interest. </p>

<p><a name="P52_9670"></a><b>970.0371-7   Outside employment of contractor employees.</b></p>

<p>Employees of a management and operating contractor are entitled to the same rights and privileges with respect to outside employment as other citizens. Therefore, there is no general prohibition against contractor employees having outside employment. However, no employee of a contractor performing work on a full or part-time basis under a DOE management and operating contract may engage in employment outside official hours of duty or while on leave if such employment will: </p>

<p>(a) In any manner interfere with the proper and effective performance of the duties of the position; </p>

<p>(b) Appear to create a conflict-of-interest situation, or</p>

<p>(c) Appear to subject DOE or the contractor to public criticism or embarrassment. </p>

<p><a name="P57_10444"></a><b>970.0371-8   Employee disclosure concerning other employment services.</b></p>

<p>(a) Management and operating contractors are responsible for requiring its employees to file with the contractor, a written disclosure statement concerning outside employment services which involve the use of information in the area of the employee's employment with the contractor. The disclosure shall contain such information concerning the outside employment as the contractor may prescribe. As a minimum, the employee's disclosure shall: </p>

<p>(1) Acknowledge that the employee has read and is familiar with: </p>

<p>(i) The requirements and restrictions prescribed in this section, </p>

<p>(ii) DOE publication entitled, “Reporting Results of Scientific and Technical Work Funded by DOE”, and </p>

<p>(iii) The requirements of the contractor's contract with DOE relating to patents. </p>

<p>(2) Include information concerning any rate of remuneration significantly in excess of the employee's regular rate of remuneration; </p>

<p>(3) Identify any actual or potential conflicts with DOE's policies regarding conduct of employees of DOE's contractors set forth in this section; </p>

<p>(4) Address any potential impacts that such employment may have on the contractor's responsibility to report fully and promptly to DOE all significant research and development information; and</p>

<p>(5) Identify any potential conflicts such employment may have with the patent provisions of the contractor's contract with DOE. </p>

<p>(b) The contractor shall provide a copy of all disclosures to the contracting officer. </p>

<p><a name="P68_11962"></a><b>970.0371-9   Contract clause.</b></p>

<p><a name="P142_26804"></a><b>970.1100-1   Performance-based contracting.</b></p>

<p>(a) It is the policy of the Department of Energy (DOE) to use, to the maximum extent practicable, performance-based contracting methods in its management and operating contracts. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy's Seven Steps to Performance-Based Acquisition located at Web site <i>http://www.acquisition.gov/comp/seven_steps/home.html</i> provides guidance concerning the development and use of performance-based contracting concepts and methodologies that may be generally applied to management and operating contracts. Performance-based contracts: Describe performance requirements in terms of results rather than methods of accomplishing the work; use measurable (i.e., terms of quality, timeliness, quantity) performance standards and objectives and quality assurance surveillance plans; provide performance incentives (positive or negative) where appropriate; and specify procedures for award or incentive fee reduction when work activities are not performed or do not meet contract requirements.</p>

<p>(b) The use of performance-based statements of work, where feasible, is the preferred method for establishing work requirements. Such statements of work and other documents used to establish work requirements (such as work authorization directives) should describe performance requirements and expectations in terms of outcome, results, or final work products, as opposed to methods, processes, or design. </p>

<p>(c) Contract performance requirements and expectations should be consistent with the Department's strategic planning goals and objectives, as made applicable to the site or facility through Departmental programmatic and financial planning processes. Measurable performance criteria, objective measures, and where appropriate, performance incentives, shall be structured to correspond to the performance requirements established in the statement of work and other documents used to establish work requirements. </p>

<p>(d) Quality assurance surveillance plans shall be developed to facilitate the assessment of contractor performance and ensure the appropriateness of any award or incentive fee payment. Such plans shall be tailored to the contract performance objectives, criteria, and measures, and shall, to the maximum extent practicable, focus on the level of performance required by the performance objectives rather than the methodology used by the contractor to achieve that level of performance. </p>

<p>(2) It is the policy of the Department, when work elements cannot be fixed price, incentive fees (including award fees) tied to objective measures should be used to the maximum extent appropriate. </p>

<p>(3) When work elements cannot be fixed price and award fees are employed, they should be tied to either objective or subjective measures. Each measure should, to the maximum extent appropriate, be directly tied to a specific portion of the fee pool. </p>

<p>(c) Fee objectives and amounts are to be determined for each contract. Standard fees or across-the-board fee agreements will not be used or made. Due to the nature of funding management and operating contracts, it is anticipated that fee shall be established in accordance with the annual funding cycle; however, with the prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, a longer period may be used where necessary to incentivize performance objectives that span funding cycles or to optimize cost reduction efforts. </p>

<p>(d) Annual fee amounts shall be established in accordance with this subsection. Annual amounts shall not exceed maximum amounts derived from the appropriate fee schedule (and Classification Factor, if applicable) unless approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. In no event shall any fee exceed statutory limits imposed by 41 U.S.C. 254(b). </p>

<p>(e)(1) Contracting Officers shall include negative fee incentives in contracts when appropriate. A negative fee incentive is one in which the contractor will not be paid the full target fee amount when the actual performance level falls below the target level established in the contract. </p>

<p>(2) Negative fee incentives may only be used when— </p>

<p>(i) A target level of performance can be established, which the contractor can reasonably be expected to reach; </p>

<p>(ii) The value of the negative incentive is commensurate with the lower level of performance and any additional administrative costs; </p>

<p>(iii) Factors likely to prevent attainment of the target level of performance are clearly within the control of the contractor; and</p>

<p>(iv) The contract indicates clearly a level below which performance is not acceptable. </p>

<p>(f) Prior to the issuance of a competitive solicitation or the initiation of negotiations for an extension of an existing contract, the HCA shall coordinate the maximum available fee, as allowed by 970.1504-1-1, and the fee amount targeted for negotiation, if less, with the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. Solicitations shall identify maximum available fee under the contract and may invite offerors to propose fee less than the maximum available. </p>

<p>(g) When a contract subject to this subsection requires a contractor to use its own facilities or equipment, or other resources to make its own cost investment for contract performance, (e.g., when there is no letter-of-credit financing) consideration may be given, subject to approval by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, to increasing the total available fee amount above that otherwise provided by this subsection. </p>

<p>(h) Multiple fee arrangements should be used in accordance with 970.1504-1-4. </p>

<p>(i)(1) In addition to other performance requirements specified in the contract, DOE management and operating contractors and other contractors designated by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, are subject to performance requirements relating to: environment, safety, and health (ES&amp;H), including worker safety and health (WS&amp;H); and safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. Performance requirements relating to ES&amp;H will be set forth in the contract's ES&amp;H terms and conditions, including a DOE approved Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS), or similar document. As applicable, performance requirements relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information will be set forth in the clauses of the contract entitled “Security” and “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives,” as well as in other terms and conditions that prescribe requirements for the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. </p>

<p>(2) If the contractor does not meet the performance requirements of the contract relating to ES&amp;H or to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information, otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings may be unilaterally reduced by the contracting officer in accordance with the clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts.” </p>

<p>(3) The clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts,” provides for reductions of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings under the contract depending upon the severity of the contractor's performance failure relating to ES&amp;H requirements and, if applicable, relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. When reviewing performance failures that would otherwise warrant a potential reduction of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings, the contracting officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range specified in the clause. Some of the mitigating factors that must be considered are included in the clause.</p>

<p>(4) The contracting officer must obtain the concurrence of the cognizant Program Secretarial Officer </p>

<p>(i) Prior to effecting any reduction of fee or profit in accordance with the terms and conditions of the clause entitled, “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts;” and </p>

<p>(ii) For determinations that no reduction of fee or profit is warranted for a particular performance failure(s) that would otherwise be subject to a reduction.</p>

<p><a name="P191_38067"></a><b>970.1504-1-3   Special considerations: Laboratory management and operation.</b></p>

<p>(a) For the management and operation of a laboratory, the contracting officer shall consider whether any fee is appropriate. Considerations should include: </p>

<p>(1) The nature and extent of financial or other liability or risk assumed or to be assumed under the contract; </p>

<p>(2) The proportion of retained earnings (as established under generally accepted accounting methods) that are utilized to fund the performance of work related to the DOE contracted effort; </p>

<p>(3) Facilities capital or capital equipment acquisition plans; </p>

<p>(4) Other funding needs, to include contingency funding, working capital funding, and provision for funding unreimbursed costs deemed ordinary and necessary; </p>

<p>(5) The utility of fee as a performance incentive; and </p>

<p>(6) The need for fee to attract qualified contractors, organizations, and institutions.</p>

<p>(b) In the event fee is considered appropriate, the contracting officer shall determine the amount of fee in accordance with this subsection. </p>

<p>(1) Costs incurred in the operation of a laboratory that are allowable and allocable under the cost principles (i.e., commercial using 48 CFR 31.2, nonprofit using OMB Circular A-122, or university-affiliated using OMB Circular A-21), regulations (including subpart 970.31), or statutes applicable to the operating contractor should be classified as direct or indirect (overhead or G&amp;A) charges to the contract and not included as proposed fee. Exceptions must be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. </p>

<p>(2) Except as specified in 970.1504-1-3(c)(3), the maximum total amount of fee shall be calculated in accordance with 970.1504-1-5 or 970.1504-1-9, as appropriate. The total amount of fee under any laboratory management and operating contract or other designated contract shall not exceed, and may be significantly less than, the result of that calculation. In determining the total amount of fee, the contracting officer shall consider the evaluation of the factors in paragraph (a) of this subsection as well as any benefits the laboratory operator will receive due to its tax status. </p>

<p>(c) In the event fee is considered appropriate, the contracting officer shall establish the type of fee arrangement in accordance with this subsection. </p>

<p>(1) The amount of fee may be established as total available fee with a base fee portion and a performance fee portion. Base fee, if any, shall be an amount in recognition of the risk of financial liability assumed by the contractor and shall not exceed the cost risk associated with those liabilities or the amount calculated in accordance with 970.1504-1-5, whichever is less. The total available fee, excepting any base fee, shall normally be associated with performance at or above the target level of performance as defined by the contract. If performance in either of the two general work categories appropriate for laboratories (science/technology and support) is rated at less than the target level of performance, the total amount of the available fee shall be subject to downward adjustment. Such downward adjustment shall be subject to the terms of the clause at 970.5215-3, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts, if contained in the contract. </p>

<p>(2) The amount of fee may be established as a fixed fee in recognition of the risk of financial liability to be assumed by the contractor, with such fixed fee amount not exceeding the cost risk associated with the liabilities assumed or the amount of fee calculated in accordance with 970.1504-1-5, whichever is less. </p>

<p>(3) If the fixed fee or total available fee exceeds 75% of the fee that would be calculated per 970.1504-1-5 or 970.1504-1-9; or if a fee arrangement other than one of those set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) or (2) of this subsection is considered appropriate, the approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, shall be obtained prior to its use. </p>

<p>(4) Fee, if any, as well as the type of fee arrangement, will normally be established for the life of the contract. It will be established at time of award, as part of the extend/compete decision, at the time of option exercise, or at such other time as the parties can mutually reach agreement, e.g., negotiations. Such agreement shall require the approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. </p>

<p>(5) Fee established for longer than one year shall be subject to adjustment in the event of a significant change (greater than ±10% or a lessor amount if appropriate) to the budget or work scope. </p>

<p>(6) Retained earnings (reserves) shall be identified and a plan for their use and disposition developed. </p>

<p>(7) The use of retained earnings as a result of performance of laboratory management and operation may be restricted if the operator is an educational institution. </p>

<p>[65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 68 FR 68781, Dec. 10, 2003; 74 FR 36371, 36378, July 22, 2009]</p>

<p><a name="P211_43025"></a><b>970.1504-1-4   Types of contracts and fee arrangements.</b></p>

<p>(a) Contract types and fee arrangements suitable for management and operating contracts may include cost, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, firm-fixed-price or any combination thereof (see 48 CFR subpart 16.1). In accordance with 48 CFR 970.1504-1-2(b)(1), the fee arrangement chosen for each work element should reflect the financial risk for project failure that contractors are willing to accept. Contracting officials shall structure each contract and the elements of the work in such a manner that the risk is manageable and, therefore, assumable by the contractor. </p>

<p>(b) Consistent with the concept of a performance-based management contract, those contract types which incentivize performance and cost control are preferred over a cost-plus-fixed-fee arrangement. Accordingly, a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract in instances other than those set forth in 970.1504-1-3(c)(2) may only be used when approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. </p>

<p>(c) A cost-plus-award-fee contract is generally the appropriate contract type for a management and operating contract. </p>

<p>(1) Where work cannot be adequately defined to the point that a fixed price contract is acceptable, the attainment of acquisition objectives generally will be enhanced by using a cost-plus-award-fee contract or other incentive fee arrangement to effectively motivate the contractor to superior performance and to provide the Department with flexibility to evaluate actual performance and the conditions under which it was achieved. </p>

<p>(2) The construct of fee for a cost-plus-award-fee management and operating contract is that total available fee will equal a base fee amount and a performance fee amount. The total available fee amount including the performance fee amount the contractor may earn, in whole or in part during performance, shall be established annually (or as otherwise agreed to by the parties and approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee), in an amount sufficient to motivate performance excellence. </p>

<p>(3) However, consistent with concepts of performance-based contracting, it is Departmental policy to place fee at risk based on performance. Accordingly, a base fee amount will be available only when approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, except as permitted in 970.1504-1-3(c)(1). Any base fee amount shall be fixed, expressed as a percent of the total available fee at inception of the contract, and shall not exceed that percent during the life of the contract. </p>

<p>(4) The performance fee amount may consist of an objective fee component and a subjective fee component. Objective performance measures, when appropriately applied, provide greater incentives for superior performance than do subjective performance measures and should be used to the maximum extent appropriate. Subjective measures should be used when it is not feasible to devise effective predetermined objective measures applicable to cost, technical performance, or schedule for particular work elements. </p>

<p>(d) Consistent with performance-based contracting concepts, performance objectives and measures related to performance fee should be as clearly defined as possible and, where feasible, expressed in terms of desired performance results or outcomes. Specific measures for determining performance achievement should be used. The contract should identify the amount and allocation of fee to each performance result or outcome. </p>

<p>(e) Because the nature and complexity of the work performed under a management and operating contract may be varied, opportunities may exist to utilize multiple contract types and fee arrangements. Consistent with paragraph (a) of this subsection and 48 CFR subpart 16.1, the contracting officer should apply that contract type or fee arrangement most appropriate to the work component. However, multiple contract types or fee arrangements— </p>

<p>(1) Must conform to the requirements of 48 CFR part 915 and 48 CFR parts 15 and 16, and </p>

<p>(2) Where appropriate to the type, must be supported by— </p>

<p>(i) Negotiated costs subject to the requirements of the Truth in Negotiations Act, </p>

<p>(ii) A pre-negotiation memorandum, and </p>

<p>(iii) A plan describing how each contract type or fee arrangement will be administered. </p>

<p>(f) Cost reduction incentives are addressed in the clause at 970.5215-4, Cost Reduction. This clause provides for incentives for quantifiable cost reductions associated with contractor proposed changes to a design, process, or method that has an established cost, technical, and schedule baseline, is defined, and is subject to a formal control procedure. The clause is to be included in management and operating contracts as appropriate. Proposed changes must be: Initiated by the contractor, innovative, applied to a specific project or program, and not otherwise included in an incentive under the contract. Such cost reduction incentives do not constitute fee and are not subject to statutory or regulatory fee limitations; however, they are subject to all appropriate requirements set forth in this subpart. </p>

<p>(g) Operations and field offices shall take the lead in developing and implementing the most appropriate pricing arrangement or cost reduction incentive for the requirements. Pricing arrangements which provide incentives for performance and cost control are preferred over those that do not. The operations and field offices are to ensure that the necessary resources and infrastructure exist within both the contractor's and government's organizations to prepare, evaluate, and administer the pricing arrangement or cost reduction incentive prior to its implementation. </p>

<p>[65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 74 FR 36371, 36378, July 22, 2009; 75 FR 68220, Nov. 5, 2010]</p>

<p><a name="P229_48870"></a><b>970.1504-1-5   General considerations and techniques for determining fixed fees.</b></p>

<p>(a) The Department's fee policy recognizes that fee is remuneration to contractors for the entrepreneurial function of organizing and managing resources, the use of their resources (including capital resources), and, as appropriate, their assumption of the risk that some incurred costs (operating and capital) may not be reimbursed. </p>

<p>(b) Use of a purely cost-based structured approach for determining fee objectives and amounts for DOE management and operating contracts is inappropriate considering the limited level of contractor cost, capital goods, and operating capital outlays for performance of such contracts. Instead of being solely cost-based, the desirable approach calls for a structure that allows evaluation of the following eight significant factors, as outlined in order of importance, and the assignment of appropriate fee values (subject to the limitations on fixed fee in 970.1504-1-6)— </p>

<p>(1) The presence or absence of financial risk, including the type and terms of the contract; </p>

<p>(2) The relative difficulty of work, including specific performance objectives, environment, safety and health concerns, and the technical and administrative knowledge, and skill necessary for work accomplishment and experience; </p>

<p>(3) Management risk relating to performance, including— </p>

<p>(i) Composite risk and complexity of principal work tasks required to do the job; </p>

<p>(ii) Labor intensity of the job; </p>

<p>(iii) Special control problems; and </p>

<p>(iv) Advance planning, forecasting and other such requirements; </p>

<p>(4) Degree and amount of contract work required to be performed by and with the contractor's own resources, as compared to the nature and degree of subcontracting and the relative complexity of subcontracted efforts, subcontractor management and integration; </p>

<p>(5) Size and operation (number of locations, plants, differing operations, etc.); </p>

<p>(6) Influence of alternative investment opportunities available to the contractor (i.e., the extent to which undertaking a task for the Government displaces a contractor's opportunity to make a profit with the same staff and equipment in some other field of activity); </p>

<p>(7) Benefits which may accrue to the contractor from gaining experience and knowledge of how to do something, from establishing or enhancing a reputation, or from having the opportunity to hold or expand a staff whose loyalties are primarily to the contractor; and </p>

<p>(8) Other special considerations, including support of Government programs such as those relating to small and minority business subcontracting, energy conservation, etc. </p>

<p>(c) The total fee objective for a particular annual fixed fee negotiation is established by evaluating the factors in this subsection, assigning fee values to them, and totaling the resulting amounts (subject to limitations on total fixed fee in 48 CFR 970.1504-1-6). </p>

<p><a name="P487_54308"></a><b>970.1504-1-7   Fee base.</b></p>

<p>(a) The fee base is an estimate of necessary allowable costs, with some exclusions. It is used in the fee schedules to determine the maximum annual fee for a fixed fee contract. That portion of the fee base that represents the cost of the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed, shall be exclusive of the cost of source and special nuclear materials; estimated costs of land, buildings and facilities whether to be leased, purchased or constructed; depreciation of Government facilities; and any estimate of effort for which a separate fee is to be negotiated. </p>

<p>(b) Such portion of the fee base, in addition to the adjustments in paragraph (a) of this subsection, shall exclude— </p>

<p>(1) Any part of the estimated cost of capital equipment (other than special equipment) which the contractor procures by subcontract or other similar costs which is of such magnitude or nature as to distort the technical and management effort actually required of the contractor; </p>

<p>(2) At least 20% of the estimated cost or price of subcontracts and other major contractor procurements; </p>

<p>(3) Up to 100% of the estimated cost or price of subcontracts and other major contractor procurements if they are of a magnitude or nature as to distort the technical and management effort actually required of the contractor; </p>

<p>(4) Special equipment as defined in 970.1504-1-8; </p>

<p>(5) Estimated cost of Government-furnished property, services and equipment; </p>

<p>(6) All estimates of costs not directly incurred by or reimbursed to the operating contractor; </p>

<p>(7) Estimates of home office or corporate general and administrative expenses that shall be reimbursed through the contract; </p>

<p>(8) Estimates of any independent research and development cost or bid and proposal expenses that may be approved under the contract; </p>

<p>(9) Any cost of work funded with uncosted balances previously included in a fee base of this or any other contract performed by the contractor; </p>

<p>(10) Cost of rework attributable to the contractor; and </p>

<p>(11) State taxes. </p>

<p>(c) In calculating the annual fee amounts associated with the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed, the fee base is to be allocated to the category reflecting the work to be performed and the appropriate fee schedule utilized. </p>

<p>(d) The portion of the fee base associated with the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed and the associated schedules in this part are not intended to reflect the portion of the fee base or related compensation for unusual architect-engineer, construction services, or special equipment provided by the management and operating contractor. Architect-engineer and construction services are normally covered by special agreements based on the policies applying to architect-engineer or construction contracts. Fees paid for such services shall be calculated using the provisions of 915.404-4-71-5 relating to architect-engineer or construction fees and shall be in addition to the operating fees calculated for the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed. Special equipment purchases shall be addressed in accordance with the provisions of 970.1504-1-8 relating to special equipment. </p>

<p>(e) No schedule set forth in 915.404-4-71-5 or 970.1504-1-6 shall be used more than once in the determination of the fee amount for an annual period, unless prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, is obtained. </p>

<p>[65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 74 FR 36371, 36378, July 22, 2009]</p>

<p><a name="P505_57936"></a><b>970.1504-1-8   Special equipment purchases.</b></p>

<p>(a) Special equipment is sometimes procured in conjunction with management and operating contracts. When a contractor procures special equipment, the DOE negotiating official shall determine separate fees for the equipment which shall not exceed the maximum fee allowable as established using the schedule in 915.404-4-71-5(h). </p>

<p>(b) In determining appropriate fees, factors such as complexity of equipment, ratio of procurement transactions to volume of equipment to be purchased and completeness of services should be considered. Where possible, the reasonableness of the fees should be checked by their relationship to actual costs of comparable procurement services. </p>

<p>(c) For purposes of this subsection, special equipment is equipment for which the purchase price is of such a magnitude compared to the cost of installation as to distort the amount of technical direction and management effort required of the contractor. Special equipment is of a nature that requires less management attention. When a contractor procures special equipment, the DOE negotiating official shall determine separate fees for the equipment using the schedule in 915.404-4-71-5(h). The determination of specific items of equipment in this category requires application of judgment and careful study of the circumstances involved in each project. This category of equipment would generally include: </p>

<p>(1) Major items of prefabricated process or research equipment; and </p>

<p>(2) Major items of preassembled equipment such as packaged boilers, generators, machine tools, and large electrical equipment. In some cases, it would also include special apparatus or devices such as reactor vessels and reactor charging machines. </p>

<p><a name="P512_59743"></a><b>970.1504-1-9   Special considerations: Cost-plus-award-fee.</b></p>

<p>(a) When a management and operating contract is to be awarded on a cost-plus-award-fee basis, several special considerations are appropriate. </p>

<p>(b) All annual performance incentives identified under these contracts are funded from the annual total available fee, which consists of a base fee amount (which may be zero) and a performance fee amount (which typically will consist of an incentive fee component for objective performance requirements, an award fee component for subjective performance requirements, or both). </p>

<p>(c) The annual total available fee for the contract shall equal the product of the fee(s) that would have been calculated for an annual fixed fee contract and the classification factor(s) most appropriate for the facility/task. If more than one fee schedule is applicable to the contract, the annual total available fee shall be the sum of the available fees derived proportionately from each fee schedule; consideration of significant factors applicable to each fee schedule; and application of a Classification Factor(s) most appropriate for the work. </p>

<p>(d) Classification Factors applied to each Facility/Task Category are: </p>

<p>(g) Any risks which are indemnified by the Government (for example, by the Price-Anderson Act) will not be considered as risk to the contractor. </p>

<p>(h) All management and operating contracts awarded on a cost-plus-award-fee basis shall set forth in the contract, or the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) required by the contract clause at 970.5215-1, Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount, a site specific method of rating the contractor's performance of the contract requirements and a method of fee determination tied to the method of rating. </p>

<p>(i) Prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, is required for an annual total available fee amount exceeding the guidelines in paragraph (c) of this subsection. </p>

<p>(j) DOE Operations/Field Office Managers must ensure that all important areas of contract performance are specified in the contract or Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s), even if such areas are not assigned specific weights or percentages of available fee. </p>

<p><a name="P595_71930"></a><b>970.1706-1   Award, renewal, and extension.</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Contract term.</i> Effective work performance under a management and operating contract is facilitated by the use of a relatively long contract term of up to ten (10) years. Accordingly, management and operating contracts shall provide for a basic contract term not to exceed five (5) years and may include an option(s) to extend the term for additional periods; provided, that no one option period exceeds five (5) years in duration and the total term of the contract, including any options exercised, does not exceed ten (10) years. The specific term of the base period and of any options periods shall be determined at the time of the authorization to compete or extend the contract. The term “option” as used in this subpart means a unilateral right in the contract by which the Government can extend the term of the contract. Accordingly, except as may be provided for through the inclusion of an option(s) in the contract to extend the term, any extension to continue the contract with the incumbent contractor beyond its term shall only occur when such extension can be justified under one of the statutory authorities identified in 48 CFR 6.302 and when authorized by the Head of the Agency. </p>

<p>(b) <i>Exercise of option.</i> As part of the review required by 48 CFR 17.605(b), the contracting officer shall assess whether competing the contract will produce a more advantageous offer than exercising the option. The incumbent contractor's past performance under the contract, the extent to which performance-based management contract provisions are present, or can be negotiated into, the contract, and the impact of a change in a contractor on the Department's discharge of its programs are considerations that shall be addressed in the contracting officer's decision that the exercise of the option is in the Government's best interest. The contracting officer's decision shall be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive and the cognizant Assistant Secretary(s). </p>

<p>(c) <i>Conditional Authorization of Non-competitive Extension Made Pursuant to Authority Under CICA.</i> Authorization to extend a management and operating contract by the Head of the Agency shall be considered conditional upon the successful negotiation of the contract to be extended in accordance with the Department's negotiation objectives. The Head of the Contracting Activity shall advise the Senior Procurement Executive no later than 6 months after receipt of the conditional authorization as to whether the Department's objectives will be met and, if not, the contracting activity's plans for competing the requirement. </p>

<p><a name="P642_80056"></a><b>970.2201-1-2   Policies.</b></p>

<p>(a) The extent of Government ownership of the nation's energy plant and materials, and the overriding concerns of national defense and security, impose special conditions on personnel and labor relations in the energy program. Such special conditions include the need for continuity of vital operations at DOE installations; retention by DOE of absolute authority on all questions of security; and DOE review of labor expenses under management and operating contracts as a part of its responsibility for assuring judicious expenditure of public funds. It is the intent of DOE that personnel and labor policies throughout the energy program reflect the best experience of American industry in aiming to achieve the type of stable labor-management relations that are essential to the proper development of the energy program. The following enunciates the principles upon which the DOE policy is based: </p>

<p>(1) <i>Employment standards.</i> (i) Management and operating contractors are expected to bring experienced, proven personnel from their private operations to staff key positions on the contract and to recruit other well-qualified personnel as needed. Such personnel should be employed and treated during employment without discrimination by reason of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin. Contractors shall be required to take affirmative action to achieve these objectives.</p>

<p>(ii) The Contractor must conduct a thorough review, as defined at 904.401, of an uncleared applicant's or uncleared employee's background, and test the individual for illegal drugs, as part of its determination to select that individual for a position requiring a DOE access authorization.</p>

<p>(A) A review must— Verify an uncleared applicant's or uncleared employee's educational background, including any high school diploma obtained within the past five years, and degrees or diplomas granted by an institution of higher learning; contact listed employers for the last three years and listed personal references; conduct local law enforcement checks when such checks are not prohibited by state or local law or regulation and when the uncleared applicant or uncleared employee resides in the jurisdiction where the contractor is located; and conduct a credit check and other checks as appropriate.</p>

<p>(B) Contractor reviews are not required for an applicant for DOE access authorization who possesses a current access authorization from DOE or another federal agency, or whose access authorization may be reapproved without a federal background investigation pursuant to Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information (August 4, 1995), Sections 3.3(c) and (d).</p>

<p>(C) In collecting and using this information to make a determination as to whether it is appropriate to select an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee for a position requiring an access authorization, the contractor must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders, including those—</p>

<p>(<i>1</i>) Governing the processing and privacy of an individual's information by employers, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; and</p>

<p>(<i>2</i>) Prohibiting discrimination in employment, such as under the ADA, Title VII and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, including with respect to pre- and post-offer of employment disability related questioning.</p>

<p>(iii) In addition to a review, each candidate for a DOE access authorization must be tested to demonstrate the absence of any illegal drug, as defined in 10 CFR 707.4. All positions requiring access authorizations are deemed <i>testing designated positions</i> in accordance with 10 CFR part 707. All employees possessing access authorizations are subject to applicant, random or for cause testing for use of illegal drugs. DOE will not process candidates for a DOE access authorization unless their tests confirm the absence of any illegal drug.</p>

<p>(iv) When an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee is hired specifically for a position that requires a DOE access authorization, the contractor shall not place that individual in that position prior to the access authorization being granted by DOE, unless an approval has been obtained from the contracting officer, acting in consultation for these purposes with the head of the cognizant local security office. If an uncleared employee is placed in that position prior to an access authorization being granted by the contracting officer, the uncleared employee may not be afforded access to classified information or matter or special nuclear material (in categories requiring access authorization) until the contracting officer notifies the employer that an access authorization has been granted.</p>

<p>(v)(A) The contractor must furnish to the head of the cognizant local DOE Security Office, in writing, the following information concerning each uncleared applicant or uncleared employee who is selected for a position requiring an access authorization—</p>

<p>(<i>1</i>) The date(s) each review was conducted;</p>

<p>(<i>2</i>) Each entity contacted that provided information concerning the individual;</p>

<p>(<i>3</i>) A certification that the review was conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders, including those governing the processing and privacy of an individual's information collected during the review;</p>

<p>(<i>4</i>) A certification that all information collected during the review was reviewed and evaluated in accordance with the contractor's personnel policies; and</p>

<p>(<i>5</i>) The results of the test for illegal drugs.</p>

<p>When a DOE access authorization will be required, the aforementioned review must be conducted and the required information forwarded to DOE before a request is made to DOE to process the individual for an access authorization.</p>

<p>(vi) Management and operating contractors and other contractors operating DOE facilities shall include the requirements set forth in this subsection in subcontracts (appropriately modified to identify the parties) wherein subcontract employees will be required to hold DOE access authorizations in order to perform on-site duties, such as protective force operations.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Security.</i> On all matters of security at its facilities, DOE retains absolute authority and neither the regulations and policies pertaining to security, nor their administration, are matters for collective bargaining between the contractor's management and labor. Insofar as DOE security regulations affect the collective bargaining process, the security policies and regulations will be made known to both parties. To the fullest extent feasible, DOE will consult with representatives of the contractor's management and labor when formulating security regulations and policies that may affect the collective bargaining process. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Wages, salaries, and employee benefits.</i> (i) Wages, salaries, and employee benefits shall be administered in a manner designated to adapt the normal practices and conditions of industry or institutions of higher education to the contract work, and to provide for appropriate review by DOE. Area practices, valid patterns, and well-established commercial or academic practices of the contractors, as appropriate, form the criteria for the establishment and adjustment of compensation schedules. </p>

<p>(ii) The aspects of wages, hours, and working conditions which are the substance of collective bargaining in normal organized industries will be left to the orderly processes of negotiation and agreement between DOE contractor management and employee representatives with maximum possible freedom from Government interference. </p>

<p>(4) <i>Employee relations.</i> The handling of employee relations on contract work, including such matters as the conduct and discipline of the work force and the handling of employee grievances, is part of the normal management responsibility of the contractor. </p>

<p>(5) <i>Collective bargaining.</i> (i) DOE review of collective bargaining practices will be premised on the view that management's trusteeship for the operation of the Government facilities includes the duty to adopt practices which are fundamental to the friendly adjustment of disputes, and which experience has shown, promote orderly collective bargaining relationships. Practices inconsistent with this view may be objected to if not found to be otherwise clearly warranted. </p>

<p>(ii) Consistent with the policy of assuring continuity of operation of vital facilities, all collective bargaining agreements at DOE-owned facilities should provide that grievances and disputes involving the interpretation or application of the agreement will be settled without resorting to strike, lockout, or other interruption of normal operations. For this purpose, each collective bargaining agreement entered into during the period of performance of this contract should provide an effective grievance procedure with arbitration as its final step, unless the parties mutually agree upon some other method of assuring continuity of operation for the term of the collective bargaining agreement. </p>

<p>(iii) DOE expects its management and operating contractors and the unions representing the contractor's employees to cooperate fully with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. </p>

<p>(6) <i>Personnel training.</i> DOE encourages and supports personnel training programs aimed at improving work efficiency or developing needed skills which are not otherwise obtainable. </p>

<p>(7) <i>Working conditions.</i> Accident, fire, health, and occupational hazards associated with DOE activities will be held to a practical minimum level and controlled in the interest of maintenance of health and prevention of accidents. Subject to DOE control, contractors shall be required to maintain comprehensive continuous preventive and protective programs appropriate to the particular activities throughout all operations. Appropriate financial protection in case of occupational disability must be provided to employees on DOE projects. </p>

<p>(b) Title to payroll and associated records under certain contracts for the management and operation of DOE facilities, and for necessary miscellaneous construction incidental to the function of these facilities, shall vest in the Government. Such records are to be disposed of in accordance with DOE directions. For such contracts, the Solicitor of Labor has granted a tolerance from the Department of Labor Regulations to omit from the prescribed labor clauses the requirement for the retention of payrolls and associated records for a period of three years after completion of the contract. Under this tolerance, the records retention requirements for all labor clauses in the contract and the Fair Labor Standards Act are satisfied by disposal of such records in accordance with applicable DOE directives. </p>

<p><a name="P682_91823"></a><b>970.2204-1-1   Administrative controls and criteria for application of the Davis-Bacon Act in operational or maintenance activities.</b></p>

<p>(a) Particular work items falling within one or more of the following criteria normally will be classified as non-covered by the Davis-Bacon Act, hereinafter referred to in this section as the “Act.” </p>

<p>(1) Individual work items estimated to cost $2,000 or less. The total dollar amount of the management and operating contract is not a factor to be considered and bears no relation to individual work items classified as construction, alteration and/or repair, including painting and decorating. However, no item of work, the cost of which is estimated to be in excess of $2,000, shall be artificially divided into portions less than $2,000 for the purpose of avoiding the application of the Act. </p>

<p>(2) Work and services that are a part of operational and maintenance activities or which, being very closely and directly involved therewith, are more in the nature of operational activities than construction, alteration, and/or repair work. This includes work and services which would involve a material risk to continuity of operations, to life or property, or to DOE operating requirements, if performed by persons other than the contractor's regular production and maintenance forces. However, any decision that contracts or work items are non-covered for these reasons must be made by the Head of the Contracting Activity without power of delegation. </p>

<p>(3) Assembly, modification, setup, installation, replacement, removal, rearrangement, connection, testing, adjustment, and calibration of machinery and equipment. However, it is noted that these activities are covered if they are part of, or would be a logical part of, the construction of a facility, or if construction-type work which is not “incidental” to the overall effort is involved. </p>

<p>(4) Experimental development of equipment, processes, or devices, including assembly, fitting, installation, testing, reworking, and disassembly. This refers to equipment, processes, and devices which are assembled for the purpose of conducting a test or experiment. The design may be only conceptual in character, and professional personnel who are responsible for the experiment participate in the assembly. Specifically excluded from the category of experimental development are buildings and building utility services, as distinguished from temporary connections thereto. Also specifically excluded from this category is equipment to be used for continuous testing (e.g., a machine to be continuously used for testing the tensile strength of structural members). </p>

<p>(5) Experimental work in connection with peaceful uses of nuclear energy. This refers to equipment, processes and devices which are assembled and/or set in place and interconnected for the purpose of conducting a test or experiment. The nature of the test or experiment is such that professional personnel who are responsible for the test or experiment and/or data to be derived therefrom must, by necessity, participate in the assembly and interconnections. Specifically excluded from experimental work are buildings, building utility services, structural changes, drilling, tunneling, excavation, and back-filling work which can be performed according to customary drawings and specifications, and utility services of modifications to utility services, as distinguished from temporary connections thereto. Work in this category may be performed in mines or in other locations specifically constructed for tests or experiments. </p>

<p>(6) Emergency work to combat the effects of fire, flood, earthquake, equipment failure, accident, or other casualties, and to restart the operational activity following the casualty. Work which is not directly related to restarting the activity or which involves rebuilding or replacement of a structure, structural components, or equipment is excluded from this category. </p>

<p>(7) Decontamination, including washing, scrubbing, and scraping to remove contamination; removal of contaminated soil or other material; and painting or other resurfacing, provided that such painting or resurfacing is an integral part of the decontamination activity and performed by the employees of the contractors performing the decontamination. </p>

<p>(8) Burial of contaminated soil waste or contained liquid; however, initial preparatory work readying the burial ground for use (e.g., any grading or excavating that is a part of initial site preparation, fencing, drilling wells for continued monitoring of contamination, construction of guard or other office space) is covered. Work performed subsequent to burial which involves the placement of concrete or other like activity is also covered. </p>

<p>(b) The classification of a contract as a contract for operational or maintenance activities does not necessarily mean that all work and activities at the contract location are classifiable as outside coverage of the Act since it may be necessary to separate work which should be classified as covered. Therefore, the Heads of Contracting Activities shall establish and maintain controls for the careful scrutiny of proposed work assignments under such contracts to assure that: </p>

<p>(1) Contractors whose contracts do not contemplate the performance of work covered by the Act with the contractor's own forces are neither asked nor authorized to perform work within the scope of the Act. If the actual work assignments do involve covered work, the contract should be modified to include applicable provisions of the Act. </p>

<p>(2) Where covered work is performed by a contractor whose contract contains provisions required by the Act, such work is performed as required by law and the contract. After the contractor has been informed, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this subsection, that certain work is covered, the responsibilities of the Head of the Contracting Activity to assure compliance is the same as it would be if the work were being performed under a separate construction contract. </p>

<p>(3) Controls provided for above include consideration by the Head of the Contracting Activity and the contractor, before work is begun or contracted out, of the relation of the Act to the annual programming of work; the contractor's work orders; and work contracted out in excess of $2,000. The Head of the Contracting Activity may, if consistent with DOE's responsibilities as described in this subsection, prescribe from time to time classes of work as to which applicability or nonapplicability of the Act is clear, for which the Head of the Contracting Activity will require no further DOE determination on coverage in advance of the work. For all work, controls to be established by the Head of the Contracting Activity should provide for notification to the contractor before work is begun as to whether such work is covered. The Head of the Contracting Activity is responsible for submitting to the Wage and Hours Division, Employment Standards Administration, Department of Labor, Washington, D.C. 20210, all DOE requests for project area or installation wage determinations, or individual determinations, or extensions or modification thereto. Requests for such determinations shall be made on Standard Form 308, at least 30 calendar days before they are required for use in advertising for bids or requests for proposals. </p>

<p>(c) <i>Experimental installations.</i> Within DOE programs, a variety of experiments are conducted involving materials, fuels, coolants, and processing equipment. Certain types of situations where tests and experiments have presented coverage questions are described as follows: </p>

<p>(1) <i>Set-ups of device and/or processes.</i> The proving out of investigative findings and theories of a scientific and technical nature may require the set-up of various devices and/or processes at an early, pre-prototype stage of development. These may range from laboratory bench size to much larger set-ups. As a rule, these set-ups are made within established facilities (normally laboratories), required utility connections are made to services provided as a part of the basic facilities, and the activity as a whole falls within the functional purpose of the facility. Such set-ups are generally not covered. However, the erection of structures which are public works is covered if construction type work, other than incidental work, is involved. Preparatory work for the set-up requiring structural changes or modifications of basic utility services, as distinguished from connections thereto, is covered. The following are illustrations of non-covered set-ups of devices and/or processes: </p>

<p>(i) Assembly of piping and equipment within existing “hot cell” facilities for proving out a conceptual design of a chemical processing unit. </p>

<p>(ii) Assembly of equipment, including adaptation and modification thereof, in existing “hot cell” facilities to prove out a conceptual design for remotely controlled machining equipment. </p>

<p>(iii) Assembly of the first graphite pile in a stadium at Stagg Field in Chicago. </p>

<p>(iv) Assembly of materials and equipment for particular aspects of the direct current thermonuclear experiments to explore feasibility and to study other ramifications of the concept of high energy injection and to collect data thereon. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Loops.</i> Many experiments are carried on in equipment assemblies, called loops, in which liquids or gases are circulated under monitored and controlled conditions. For purposes of determining coverage under the Act, loops may be classed as loop facilities or as loop set-ups. Both of these classes of loops can include in-reactor loops and out-of-reactor loops. In differentiating between clearly identified loop set-ups and loop facilities, an area exists in which there have been some questions of coverage, such as certain loops at the Material Test Reactor and at Engineering Test Reactor and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory site. Upon clarification of this area, further illustrations will be added. In the meantime, the differentiation between loop set-ups and loop facilities must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the total criteria set forth in this subpart. </p>

<p>(i) <i>Loop set-ups.</i> The assembly, erection, modification, and disassembly of a loop set-up is non-covered. A noncontroversial example of a loop set-up is one which is assembled in a laboratory, e.g., Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, or Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, for a particular test and thereafter disassembled. However, preparatory work for a loop set-up requiring structural changes or modifications of basic utility services as distinguished from connections thereto is covered, as are material and equipment that are installed for a loop set-up which is a permanent part of the facility or which is use for a succession of experimental programs. </p>

<p>(ii) <i>Loop facilities.</i> A loop facility differs from a loop set-up in that it is of a more permanent character. It is usually, but not always, of greater size. It normally involves the building or modification of a structure. Sometimes it is installed as a part of construction of the facility. It may be designed for use in a succession of experimental programs over a longer period of time. Examples of loop facilities are the in-reactor “K” loops at Hanford and the large Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion loop at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory site. The on-site assembly and erection of such loop facilities are covered. However, once a loop facility is completed and becomes operational, the criteria set forth in this paragraph for operational and maintenance activities apply. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Reactor component experiments.</i> Other experiments are carried on by insertion of experimental components within reactor systems without the use of a loop assembly. An example of reactor facilities erected for such experimental purposes are the special power excursion test reactors (SPETRs) at the National Reactor Test Site which are designed for studying reactor behavior and performance characteristics of certain reactor components. Such a facility may consist of a reactor vessel, pressurizing tank, coolant loops, pumps, heat exchangers, and other auxiliary equipment as needed. The facility also may include sufficient shielding to permit work on the reactor to proceed following a short period of power interruption, and buildings as needed to house the reactor and its auxiliary equipment. The erection and on-site assembly of such a reactor facility is covered, but the components whose characteristics are under study are excluded from coverage. To illustrate, one of the SPETRs planned for studies of nuclear reactor safety is designed to accommodate various internal fuel and control assemblies. The internal structure of the pressure vessel is designed so that cores of different shapes and sizes may be placed in the vessel for investigation, or the entire internal structure may be easily removed and replaced by a structure which will accept a different core design. Similarly, the control rod assembly is arranged to provide for flexibility in the removal of instrument leads and experimental assemblies from within the core. </p>

<p>(4) <i>Tests or experiments in peaceful uses of nuclear energy.</i> These tests or experiments are varied in nature and some are only in a planning stage. They consist of one or more nuclear or nonnuclear detonations for the purposes of acquiring data. The data can include seismic effects, radiation effects, amount of heat generated, amount of material moved and so forth. Some of these tests are conducted in existing mines, while others are conducted in facilities specifically constructed for the tests or experiments. In general, all work which can be performed in accordance with customary drawings and specifications, as well as other work in connection with preparation of facilities is treated as covered work. Such work includes tunneling, drilling, excavation and back-filling, erection of buildings or other structures, and installation of utilities. The installation of the nonnuclear material or nuclear device to be detonated, and the instrumentation and connection between such material or device and the instrumentation are treated as non-covered work. </p>

<p>(5) <i>Tests or experiments in military uses of nuclear energy.</i> As in 970.2204-1-1(c)(4), these tests or experiments can be varied in nature. However, under this category it is intended to include only detonation of nonnuclear material or nuclear devices. The material or devices can be detonated either underground, at ground level, or above the ground. These tests or experiments have been conducted in, on, or in connection with facilities specifically constructed for such tests or experiments. As in tests or experiments in peaceful uses of nuclear energy, all work which can be performed in accord with customary drawings and specifications, as well as other work in connection with preparation of facilities are treated as covered work. Such work includes building towers or similar structures, tunneling, drilling, excavation and backfilling, erection of buildings or other structures, and installation of utilities. The installation of the nonnuclear material or nuclear devices and instrumentation are treated as non-covered work. </p>

<p>(d) <i>Construction site contiguous to an established manufacturing facility.</i> As DOE-owned property sometimes encompasses several thousand acres of real estate, a number of separate facilities may be located in areas contiguous to each other on the same property. These facilities may be built over a period of years, and established manufacturing activities may be regularly carried on at one site at the same time that construction of another facility is underway at another site. On occasion, the regular manufacturing activities of the operating contractor at the first site may include the manufacture, assembly, and reconditioning of components and equipment which in other industries would normally be done in established commercial plants. While the manufacture of components and equipment in the manufacturing plant is non-covered, the installation of any such manufactured items on a construction job is covered. </p>

<p>(a) Each state has its own unemployment compensation system to provide payments to workers who become unemployed involuntarily and through no fault of their own. Funds are provided for unemployment compensation benefits through a payroll tax on employers. Most DOE contractors are subject to the unemployment compensation tax laws of the states in which they are located. It is the policy to assure, both in the negotiation and administration of cost-reimbursement type contracts, that economical and practical arrangements are made and practiced with respect to unemployment compensation. </p>

<p>(b) <i>Contract exempt from state laws.</i> (1) Some contractors are exempt from state unemployment compensation laws, usually on grounds that they are nonprofit organizations or subdivisions of State governments. Most states, however, permit such employers to elect unemployment compensation coverage on a voluntary basis. Under such circumstances, all existing or prospective cost-reimbursement contractors shall be encouraged to provide unemployment compensation coverage or equivalent substitutes. </p>

<p>(2) It is also DOE policy that, prior to the award or extension of a management and operating contract, exempt contractors or prospective contractors shall be required to submit to the contracting officer a statement that they will either elect coverage or provide equivalent substitutes for unemployment compensation, or in the alternative, submit evidence that it is impractical to do so. If any exempt contractor or prospective contractor submits that it is impractical to elect coverage or to provide an equivalent substitute, appropriate Office of Contract and Resource Management, within the Headquarters procurement organization, staff shall review that position prior to recommending an award or extension of the contract. If there are substantial reasons for not electing coverage or for not providing equivalent substitutes, a contract may be awarded or extended. Headquarters' staff review and recommendation shall be based on such factors as— </p>

<p>(i) The specific provisions of the unemployment compensation law of the State; </p>

<p>(ii) The extent to which the establishment of special conditions on DOE work may have an adverse effect on the contractor's general policies and operating costs in its private operations; </p>

<p>(iii) The numerical relationship between the contractor's private work force and its employees performing only work for DOE; </p>

<p>(iv) The contractor's record with respect to work force stability and the general outlook with respect to future work force stability; </p>

<p>(v) In a replacement contractor situation, whether or not the prior contractor had coverage or suitable substitutes; and </p>

<p>(vi) The particular labor relations implications involved. </p>

<p><a name="P836_131081"></a><b>970.2703-1   Purposes of patent rights clauses.</b></p>

<p>(a) DOE sites and facilities are managed and operated on behalf of the Department of Energy by a contractor, pursuant to management and operating contracts that are generally awarded for a five (5) year term, with the possibility for renewal. Special provisions relating to patent rights are appropriately incorporated into an M&amp;O contract because of the unique circumstances and responsibilities of managing and operating a Government-owned facility, as compared to other federally funded research and development contracts. </p>

<p>(b)(1) <i>Technology transfer mission clause.</i> In accordance with Public Law 101-189, section 3133(d), DOE may grant technology transfer authority to M&amp;O contractors operating a DOE facility. Generally, M&amp;O contractors have the right to elect to retain title to inventions made under the contract, whether a nonprofit or educational organizations, as a result of 35 U.S.C. 200 <i>et seq.</i> (Bayh-Dole Act), or a large business, as a result of a class patent waiver issued pursuant to 10 CFR part 784. Under such contracts, the M&amp;O contractor assumes responsibilities for commercializing retained inventions, in accordance with the Technology Transfer Mission clause provided at 970.5227-3. That clause also governs such activities as the distribution of royalties earned from inventions made under the contract and the transfer of patent rights in inventions made under the contract to successor contractors. </p>

<p>(2) If the M&amp;O contractor is a nonprofit organization or small business firm having technology transfer authority, the following clauses are inserted into the M&amp;O contract: 970.5227-3 and 970.5227-10. </p>

<p>(3) If the M&amp;O contract has technology transfer as a mission and is to be performed by a for-profit, large business firm that has been granted an advance class waiver, the following clauses are inserted into the M&amp;O contract: 970.5227-3 and 970.5227-12. The terms of the clause at 970.5227-12 are subject to modification to conform to the terms of the class waiver. </p>

<p>(4) If the M&amp;O contract does not have a technology transfer mission and is to be performed by a for-profit, large business firm and does not have advance class waiver under 10 CFR part 784, the patent rights clause at 970.5227-11 is inserted into the M&amp;O contract, and the Technology Transfer Mission clause is inapplicable. </p>

<p>(5) If the contractor is an educational institution, a non-profit organization or a small business firm and is conducting privately funded technology transfer activities, involving the use of private funds to conduct licensing and marketing activities related to inventions made under the contract in accordance with the Bayh-Dole Act, DOE may modify the patent rights clause (970.5227-10) to address issues such as the disposition of royalties earned under the privately funded technology transfer program, the transfer of patent rights to a successor contractor, allowable cost restrictions concerning privately funded technology transfer activities, and the Government's freedom from any liability related to licensing under the contractor's privately funded technology transfer program. </p>

<p>(c) Contracting officers must consult with DOE patent counsel assisting the contracting activity or the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property for assistance in selecting for use in the solicitation, negotiating, or approving appropriate patent rights clauses for a M&amp;O contract. It may be appropriate to include more than one patent rights clause in a solicitation if the successful contractor could, for instance, be either an educational or a large business. If a large business may be selected for performance of a contract that will include a technology transfer clause, the solicitation must include the clause at 970.5227-12 to reflect the waiver that will likely be granted. If the solicitation includes more than one patent clause, it must include an explanation of the circumstances under which the appropriate clause will be used. The final award must contain only one patent rights clause. </p>

<p><a name="P844_135176"></a><b>970.2703-2   Patent rights clause provisions for management and operating contractors.</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Allocation of Principal Rights: Bayh-Dole provisions.</i> If the management and operating contractor is an educational institution or nonprofit organization, the patent rights clause provided at 970.5227-10 must be inserted into the M&amp;O contract. Such entities are beneficiaries of Bayh-Dole Act, including the paramount right of the contractor to elect to retain title to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance of work under the contract, except in DOE-exempted areas of technology or in operation of DOE facilities primarily dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs. </p>

<p>(b) <i>Allocation of Principal Rights: Government title.</i> (1) The patent rights clause provided at 970.5227-11 must be incorporated into the M&amp;O contract if the contractor is a for-profit, large business firm and the contract does not have a technology transfer mission or if, without regard to the type of contractor, the contract is for the operation of a DOE facility primarily dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs. That clause provides for DOE's statutory obligation to take title to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under an M&amp;O contract, and does not contemplate an advance class waiver of Government rights in inventions, or participation by the contractor in technology transfer activities. </p>

<p>(2) While only in rare circumstances does a for-profit large business contractor whose contract contains no technology transfer mission receive rights in or title to inventions made under the contract, the contractor does have the right to request a license or foreign patent rights in inventions made under the contract, and may petition for a waiver of Government rights in identified inventions. The patent rights clause 970.5227-11 does not include many of the provisions of patent rights clauses 970.5227-10 and 970.5227-12, related to the filing of patent applications by the contractor, the granting of rights in inventions by the contractor to third parties (preference for United States industry), and conditions allowing the Government to grant licenses to third parties in inventions retained by the contractor (march-in rights). Any instrument granting rights in inventions made under a contract governed by patent rights clause 970.5227-11 must include these additional provisions within its terms and conditions. </p>

<p>(c) <i>Allocation of Principal Rights: Contractor right to elect title under an advance class waiver.</i> If the M&amp;O contractor is a for-profit, large business firm and the Government has granted an advance class waiver of Government rights in inventions made in the course of or under the M&amp;O contract, under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2182) and the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5908(c)), the patent rights clause provided at 970.5227-12 must be inserted into the M&amp;O contract, unless the terms and conditions of such an approved waiver alter or replace the patent rights clause provisions pursuant to 10 CFR part 784. </p>

<p>(d) <i>Extensions of time—DOE discretion.</i> The patent rights clauses for M&amp;O contracts require the contractor to take certain actions within prescribed time periods to comply with the contract and preserve its rights in inventions. The M&amp;O contractor may request extensions of time in which to take such actions by submitting written justification to DOE, and DOE may grant the contractor's requests, on a case-by-case basis. If the time period expired due to negligence by the contractor, DOE may grant a request for an extension of time upon a showing by the contractor that corrective procedures are in place to avoid such negligence in the future. If a contractor is requesting an extension of time in which to elect to retain title to an invention, DOE may grant the request if the extension allows the contractor to conduct further experimentation, market research, or other analysis helpful to determine contractor interest in electing title to the invention, among other considerations. Generally, the extensions of time are for periods of between six (6) months to one (1) year. </p>

<p>(e) <i>Facilities license.</i> These include the rights to make, use, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all articles, materials, products, or processes embodying inventions or discoveries used or embodied in the facility regardless of whether or not conceived or first actually reduced to practice under or in the course of such a contract. The patent rights clauses, 970.5227-10, 970.5227-11, 970.5227-12, each contain a provision granting the Government this facilities license. </p>

<p>(f) <i>Deletion of classified inventions provision.</i> If DOE determines that the research, development, demonstration or production work to be performed during the course of a management and operating contract most probably will not involve classified subject matter or result in any inventions that require security classification, DOE patent counsel may advise the contracting officer to delete the patent rights clause provision entitled, “Classified Inventions” from the M&amp;O contract. </p>

<p>(g) <i>Alternate 1—Weapons Related Research or Production.</i> If DOE grants technology transfer authority to a DOE facility, pursuant to Public Law 101-189, section 3133(d), and the DOE owned facility is involved in weapons related research and development, or production, then Alternate 1 of the patent rights clauses must be inserted into the M&amp;O contract. Alternate 1 defines weapons related subject inventions and restricts the contractor's rights with respect to such inventions. </p>

<p><a name="P853_140881"></a><b>970.2704   Rights in data.</b></p>

<p><a name="P854_140907"></a><b>970.2704-1   General.</b></p>

<p>(a) Rights in data relating to the performance of the contract and to all facilities are significant in assuring continuity of the management and operation of DOE facilities. It is crucial in assuring DOE's continuing ability to perform its statutory missions that DOE obtain rights to all data produced or specifically used by its management and operating contractors and appropriate subcontractors. In order to obtain the necessary rights in technical data, DOE contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contracts contain either the Rights in Data clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, or the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer. Selection of the appropriate clause is dependent upon whether technology transfer is a mission of the management and operating contract pursuant to the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, Public Law 101-189, (15 U.S.C. 3711 <i>et seq.,</i> as amended). If technology transfer is not a mission of the management and operating contract, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, shall be used. In those instances in which technology transfer is a mission of the contract, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, shall be used. </p>

<p>(b) Employees of the management and operating contractor may not be used to assist in the preparation of a proposal or bid for services which are similar or related to those being performed under the contract, which are to be performed by the contractor or its parent or affiliate organization for commercial customers unless the employee has been separated from work under the DOE contract for such period as the Head of the Contracting Activity or designee shall have directed. </p>

<p><a name="P857_142703"></a><b>970.2704-2   Procedures.</b></p>

<p>(a) The clauses at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data-Facilities, and 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, both provide generally for Government ownership and for unlimited rights in the Government for all data first produced in the performance of the contract and unlimited rights in data specifically used in the performance of the contract. Both clauses provide that, subject to patent, security, and other provisions of the contract, the contractor may use contract data for its private purposes. The contractor, under either clause, must treat any data furnished by DOE or acquired from other Government agencies or private entities in the performance of their contracts in accordance with any restrictive legends contained therein. </p>

<p>(b) Since both clauses secure access to and, if requested, delivery of technical data used in the performance of the contract, there is generally no need to use the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 in the management and operating contract. </p>

<p>(c)(1) Paragraph (d) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, and paragraph (f) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, provide for the inclusion in subcontracts of the Rights in Technical Data—General clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, with Alternate V, and modified in accordance with DEAR 927.409. Those clauses also provide for the inclusion in appropriate subcontracts Alternates II, III, and IV to the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14 with DOE's prior approval and the inclusion of the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 in all subcontracts for research, development, or demonstration and all other subcontracts having special requirements for the production or delivery of data. In subcontracts, including subcontracts for related support services, involving the design or operation of any plants or facilities or specially designed equipment for such plants or facilities that are managed or operated by the contractor under its contract with DOE, the management and operating contractor shall use the Rights in Data—Facilities clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1. </p>

<p>(2) Where, however, a subcontract is to be awarded by the management and operating contractor in connection with a program, as discussed at 927.404-70, which provides statutory authority to protect from public disclosure, data first produced under contracts awarded pursuant to the program, contracting officers shall ensure that the management and operating contractor includes in that subcontract the rights in data clause provided by DOE Patent Counsel, consistent with any accompanying guidance. </p>

<p>(3) Management and operating contractors and higher-tier subcontractors shall not use their power to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software for their private use, nor may they acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software except through the use of Alternate II or III to the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, respectively, without the prior approval of DOE Patent Counsel. </p>

<p>(d)(1) Paragraphs (e) and (f) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, and paragraphs (g) and (h) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, provide for the contractor's granting a nonexclusive license in any limited rights data and restricted computer software specifically used in performance of the contract. </p>

<p>(2) In certain instances the objectives of DOE would be frustrated if the Government did not obtain, at the time of contracting, limited license rights on behalf of responsible third parties and the Government, and to limited rights data or restricted computer software or both necessary for the practice of subject inventions or data first produced or delivered in the performance of the contract. This situation may arise in the performance of management and operating contracts and contracts for the management or operation of a DOE facility or site. Contracting officers should consult with program officials and Patent Counsel. No such rights should be obtained from a small business or non-profit organization, unless similar rights in background inventions of the small business or non-profit organization have been authorized in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(f). Where such a background license is in DOE's interest, a provision that provides substantially as Alternate VI at 48 CFR 952.227-14 should be added to the appropriate clause, 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, or 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer. </p>

<p>(e) The Rights in Data—Technology Transfer clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2 differs from the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, in the context of its more detailed treatment of copyright. In management and operating contracts that have technology transfer as a mission, the right to assert copyright in data first produced under the contract will be a valuable right, and commercialization of such data, including computer software, will assist the management and operating contractor in advancing the technology transfer mission of the contract. The clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, provides for DOE approval of DOE's taking a limited copyright license for a period of five years, and, in certain rare cases, specified longer periods in order to contribute to commercialization of the data. </p>

<p>(f) Contracting officers should consult with Patent Counsel to assure that requirements regarding royalties and conflicts of interest associated with asserting copyright in data first produced under the contract are appropriately addressed in the Technology Transfer Mission clause (48 CFR 970.5227-3) of the management and operating contract. Where it is not otherwise clear which DOE program funded the development of a computer software package, such as where the development was funded out of a contractor's overhead account, the DOE program which was the primary source of funding for the entire contract is deemed to have administrative responsibility. This issue may arise, among others, in the decision whether to grant the contractor permission to assert copyright. See paragraph (e) of the Rights in Data—Technology Transfer clause at 970.5227-2. </p>

<p>(g) In management and operating contracts involving access to DOE-owned Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, DOE has reserved the right to receive reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions and discoveries, including its related restricted data and technology. Alternate I to each clause shall be used where access to Category C-24 restricted data is contemplated in the performance of a contract. </p>

<p><a name="P868_149564"></a><b>970.2704-3   Contract clauses.</b></p>

<p>(a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, in management and operating contracts which do not contain the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer. The contracting officer shall include the clause with its Alternate I in contracts where access to Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, is to be provided to contractors. </p>

<p>(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, in management and operating contracts which contain the clause at 970.5227-3, Technology Transfer Mission.

<p><a name="P871_150433"></a><b>970.2770   Technology Transfer.</b></p>

<p><a name="P872_150464"></a><b>970.2770-1   General.</b></p>

<p>This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for implementing the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, Public Law 101-189, (15 U.S.C. 3711 <i>et seq.,</i> as amended). The Act requires that technology transfer be established as a mission of each Government-owned laboratory operated under contract by a non-Federal entity. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 expanded the definition of “laboratory” to include weapon production facilities that are operated for national security purposes and are engaged in the production, maintenance, testing, or dismantlement of a nuclear weapon or its components. </p>

<p><a name="P874_151131"></a><b>970.2770-2   Policy.</b></p>

<p>All new awards for or extensions of existing DOE laboratory or weapon production facility management and operating contracts shall have technology transfer, including authorization to award Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), as a laboratory or facility mission under Section 11(a)(1) of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, Public Law 96-480 (15 U.S.C. 3701 <i>et seq.,</i> as amended). A management and operating contractor for a facility not deemed to be a laboratory or weapon production facility may be authorized on a case-by-case basis to support the DOE technology transfer mission including, but not limited to, participating in CRADAs awarded by DOE laboratories and weapon production facilities. </p>

<p><a name="P876_151892"></a><b>970.2770-3   Technology transfer and patent rights.</b></p>

<p>The National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989 (NCTTA) established technology transfer as a mission for Government-owned, contractor-operated laboratories, including weapons production facilities, and authorizes those laboratories to negotiate and award cooperative research and development agreements with public and private entities for purposes of conducting research and development and transferring technology to the private sector. In implementing the NCTTA, DOE has negotiated technology transfer clauses with the contractors managing and operating its laboratories. Those technology transfer clauses must be read in concert with the patent rights clause required by this subpart. Thus, each management and operating contractor holds title to subject inventions for the benefit of the laboratory or facility being managed and operated by that contractor. </p>

<p><a name="P878_152819"></a><b>970.2770-4   Contract clause.</b></p>

<p>(a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5227-3, Technology Transfer Mission, in each solicitation for a new or an extension of an existing laboratory or weapon production facility management and operating contract. </p>

<p>(b) If the contractor is a nonprofit organization or small business eligible under 35 U.S.C. 200 <i>et seq.,</i> to receive title to any inventions under the contract and proposes to fund at private expense the maintaining, licensing, and marketing of the inventions, the contracting officer shall use the basic clause with its Alternate I. </p>

<p>(c) If the facility is operated for national security purposes and engaged in the production, maintenance, testing, or dismantlement of a nuclear weapon or its components, the contracting officer shall use the basic clause with its Alternate II. </p>

<p><a name="P884_153719"></a><b>970.2803-1   Workers' Compensation Insurance.</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Policies and requirements.</i> (1) Workers' compensation insurance protects employers against liability imposed by workers' compensation laws for injury or death to employees arising out of, or in the course of, their employment. This type of insurance is required by state laws unless employers have acceptable programs of self-insurance. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Special requirements.</i> Certain workers' compensation laws contain provisions which result in limiting the protection afforded persons subject to such laws. The policy with respect to these limitations as they affect persons employed by management and operating contractors is set forth as follows: </p>

<p>(i) <i>Elective provisions.</i> Some worker's compensation laws permit an employer to elect not to be subject to its provisions. It is DOE policy to require these contractors to be subject to workers' compensation laws in jurisdictions permitting election. </p>

<p>(ii) <i>Statutory immunity.</i> Under the provisions of some workers' compensation laws, certain types of employers; e.g., nonprofit educational institutions, are relieved from liability. If a contractor has a statutory option to accept liability, it is DOE policy to require the contractor to do so. </p>

<p>(iii) <i>Limited medical benefits.</i> Some workers' compensation laws limit the liability of the employer for medical care to a maximum dollar amount or to a specified period of time. In such cases, a contractor's workers' compensation insurance policy should contain a standard extra-statutory medical coverage endorsement. </p>

<p>(iv) <i>Limits on occupational disease coverage and employers' liability.</i> Some workers' compensation laws do not provide coverage for all occupational diseases. In such situations, a contractor's workers' compensation insurance policy should contain voluntary coverage for all occupational diseases. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Contractor “employees' benefit plan”</i>—<i>self-insurers.</i> The policies and requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply where management and operating contractors purchase workers' compensation insurance. With respect to self-insured contractors, the objectives specified in paragraph (a)(2) also shall be met through primary or excess workers' compensation and employers' liability insurance policy(ies) or an approved combination thereof. “Employees” benefit plans” which were established in prior years may be continued to contrast termination at existing benefit levels. </p>

<p>(b) <i>Assignment of responsibilities.</i> (1) Office of Resource Management, within the Headquarters procurement organization, other officials, and the Heads of Contracting Activities, consistent with their delegations of responsibility, shall assure management and operating contracts are consistent with the policies and requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. </p>

<p>(2) In discharging assigned responsibility, the Heads of Contracting Activities shall— </p>

<p>(i) Periodically review workers' compensation insurance programs of management and operating contractors in the light of applicable workers' compensation statutes to assure conformance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. </p>

<p>(ii) Evaluate the adequacy of coverage of “self-insured” workers” compensation programs; </p>

<p>(iii) Provide arrangements for the administration of any existing “employees” benefit plans until such plans” are terminated; and </p>

<p>(iv) Submit to the Office of Resource Management, within the Headquarters procurement organization, all proposals for the modification of existing “employees' benefit plans.” </p>

<p>(3) The Office of Resource Management, within the Headquarters procurement organization, is responsible for approving management and operating contractor “employees' benefit plans.” </p>

<p><a name="P939_162564"></a><b>970.3102-3-70   Home office expenses.</b></p>

<p>(a) For on-site work, DOE's fee for management and operating contracts, determined under the policy of and calculated per the procedures in 970.1504-1-3, generally provides adequate compensation for home or corporate office general and administrative expenses incurred in the general management of the contractor's business as a whole. </p>

<p>(1) DOE recognizes that some Home Office Expenses are incurred for the benefit of a management and operating contract. DOE has elected to recognize that benefit through fee due to the difficulty of determining the dollar value applicable to any management and operating contract. The difficulty arises because: </p>

<p>(i) The general construct of a management and operating contract results in minimal Home Office involvement in the contract work, and</p>

<p>(ii) Conventional Home Office Expense allocation techniques that use bases such as total operating costs, labor dollars, hours etc., are not appropriate because they inherently assume significant contractor investment (in terms of its own resources, such as, labor, material, overhead, etc.). Contractor investments are minimal under DOE's operating and management contracts. The contracts are totally financed by DOE advance payments, and DOE provides government-owned facilities, property, and other needed resources. </p>

<p>(2) From time to time, the fee for a management and operating contract may not be adequate compensation for Home Office Expenses incurred for the benefit of the contract. An indication that such a case exists is the need for significant home office support to deal with issues at the site that occur without the fault or negligence of the contractor, for example, the need for home office legal support to deal with third party, environmental, safety, or health issues. </p>

<p>(3) In such a case, the contracting officer, after obtaining the HCA's approval, may consider a contractor request for additional compensation. The contractor may request— </p>

<p>(i) Fee in addition to its normal fee (but see 970.1504-1-3(b)(1) if the contract is for the management and operation of a laboratory); or</p>

<p>(ii) Compensation on the basis of actual cost. </p>

<p>(4) Because the contract's fee provides some compensation for Home Office Expenses, the contractor's request for additional compensation must always be for an amount less than the Home Office Expenses that are incurred for the benefit of the management and operating contract. </p>

<p>(b) For off-site work, the DOE allows Home Office Expenses under architect-engineer, supply and research contracts with commercial contractors performing the work in their own facilities. Home Office Expenses may, however, be included for reimbursement under such DOE off-site architect-engineer, supply and research contracts, only to the extent that they are determined, after careful examination, to be allowable, reasonable, and properly allocable to the work. Work performed in a contractor's own facilities under a management and operating or construction contract may likewise be allowed to bear the properly allocable portion of allowable Home Office Expenses. </p>

<p>(a)(6) In determining the reasonableness of compensation, the compensation of each individual contractor employee normally need not be subjected to review and approval. Generally, the compensation paid individual employees should be left to the judgment of contractors subject to the limitations of DOE-approved compensation policies, programs, classification systems, and schedules, and amounts of money authorized for wage and salary increases for groups of employees. However, the contracting officer shall designate a compensation threshold appropriate for the particular situation. The contract shall specifically provide that contracting officer approval is required for compensating an individual contractor employee above the threshold if a total of 50 percent or more of such compensation is reimbursed under DOE cost-type contracts. For purposes of designating the threshold, total compensation includes only the employee's salary and cash bonus or incentive compensation. </p>

<p>(7)(i) Reimbursable costs for compensation for personal services are to be set forth in the contract. This compensation shall be set forth using the principles and policies of 48 CFR 31.205-6, Compensation, as supplemented by this section, 970.3102-05-6, and other pertinent parts of the DEAR. Costs that are unallowable under other contract terms shall not be allowable as compensation for personnel services.</p>

<p>(ii) The contract sets forth, in detail, personnel costs and related expenses allowable under the contract and documents personnel policies, practices and plans which have been found acceptable by the contracting officer. The contractor will advise DOE of any proposed changes in any matters covered by these policies, practices, or plans which relate to personnel costs. Types of personnel costs and related expenses addressed in the contract are as follows: Salaries and wages; bonuses and incentive compensation; overtime, shift differential, holiday, and other premium pay for time worked; welfare benefits and retirement programs; paid time off, and salaries and wages to employees in their capacity as union stewards and committeemen for time spent in handling grievances, or serving on labor management (contractor) committees provided, however, that the contracting officer's approval is required in each instance of total compensation to an individual employee above an annual rate as specified in the contract.</p>

<p>(p)(1) Notwithstanding the costs cited in this subsection, incurred for compensation of a senior executive in excess of the benchmark compensation amount determined applicable for the contractor fiscal year by the Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, are unallowable. Allowable costs of executive compensation shall be determined pursuant to 48 CFR 31.205-6(p). </p>

<p>(3) In special or unusual situations, actual costs in excess of the maximum per diem rates are allowable provided that such amounts do not exceed the higher amounts authorized for Federal civilian employees as permitted in the regulations referenced in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection. For such higher amounts to be allowable, all of the following conditions must be met: </p>

<p>(i) One of the conditions warranting approval of the actual expense method, as set forth in the regulations referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection, must exist. </p>

<p>(ii) A written justification for use of the higher amounts must be approved by an officer of the contractor's organization or designee to ensure that the authority is properly administered and controlled to prevent abuse. </p>

<p>(iii) If it becomes necessary to exercise the authority to use the higher actual expense method repetitively or on a continuing basis in a particular area, the contractor must obtain advance approval from the contracting officer. </p>

<p>(iv) Documentation to support actual costs incurred shall be in accordance with the contractor's established practices, subject to paragraph (a)(7) of this subsection, and provided that a receipt is required for each expenditure of $75.00 or more.

<p>(ii) Appropriate downward adjustments from the maximum per diem rates would normally be required under these circumstances. While these adjustments need not be calculated in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation or Joint Travel Regulations, they must result in a reasonable charge. </p>

<p>(7) Costs shall be allowable only if the following information is documented: </p>

<p>(i) Date and place (city, town, or other similar designation) of the expenses; </p>

<p>(ii) Purpose of the trip; and</p>

<p>(iii) Name of person on trip and that person's title or relationship to the contractor. </p>

<p>(c) Travel costs directly attributable to specific contract performance are allowable and may be charged to the contract under 48 CFR 31.202. </p>

<p>(d) Airfare costs in excess of the lowest customary standard, coach, or equivalent airfare offered during normal business hours are unallowable except when such accommodations require circuitous routing, require travel during unreasonable hours, excessively prolong travel, result in increased cost that would offset transportation savings, are not reasonably adequate for the physical or medical needs of the traveler, or are not reasonably available to meet mission requirements. However, in order for airfare costs in excess of the standard airfare to be allowable, the applicable condition(s) must be documented and justified. </p>

<p>(e)(1) “Cost of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft,” as used in this paragraph, includes the cost of lease, charter, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and other related costs. </p>

<p>(2) The costs of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft are limited to the standard airfare described in paragraph (d) of this subsection for the flight destination unless travel by such aircraft is specifically required by contract specification, term, or condition, or a higher amount is approved by the contracting officer. A higher amount may be agreed to when one or more of the circumstances for justifying higher than standard airfare listed in paragraph (d) of this subsection are applicable, or when an advance agreement under paragraph (e)(3) of this subsection has been executed. In all cases, travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft must be fully documented and justified. For each contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft used for any business purpose which is charged or allocated, directly or indirectly, to a Government contract, the contractor must maintain and make available manifest/logs for all flights on such company aircraft. As a minimum, the manifest/log shall indicate— </p>

<p>(i) Whether scheduled commercial airlines or other suitable, less costly, travel facilities are available at reasonable times, with reasonable frequency, and serve the required destinations conveniently; </p>

<p>(ii) Whether increased flexibility in scheduling results in time savings and more effective use of personnel that would outweigh additional travel costs. </p>

<p>(f) Costs of contractor-owned or -leased automobiles, as used in this paragraph, include the costs of lease, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, etc. These costs are allowable, if reasonable, to the extent that the automobiles are used for company business.

<p>(a) The contracting officer shall require that management and operating contractors provide a submission, pursuant to 970.5232-2-(j), for settlement of costs incurred during the period stipulated on the submission and a certification that the costs included in the submission are allowable. The contracting officer shall assess a penalty pursuant to 970.5242-1 if unallowable costs are included in the submission. Unallowable costs are either expressly unallowable or determined unallowable. </p>

<p>(1) An expressly unallowable cost is a particular item or type of cost which, under the express provisions of an applicable law, regulation, or this contract, is specifically named and stated to be unallowable. </p>

<p>(2) A cost determined unallowable is one which, for that contractor— </p>

<p>(i) Was subject to a contracting officer's final decision and not appealed; </p>

<p>(ii) The Civilian Board of Contract Appeals or a court has previously ruled as unallowable; or</p>

<p>(iii) Was mutually agreed to be unallowable. </p>

<p>(b) If, during the review of the submission, the contracting officer determines that the submission contains an expressly unallowable cost or a cost determined to be unallowable prior to the submission, the contracting officer shall assess a penalty. </p>

<p>(c) If the contracting officer determines that a cost submitted by the contractor in its submission for settlement is: </p>

<p>(1) Expressly unallowable, then the contracting officer shall assess a penalty in an amount equal to the disallowed cost allocated to the contract plus interest on the paid portion of the disallowed cost. Interest shall be computed from the date of overpayment to the date of repayment using the interest rate specified by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Public Law 92-41 (85 Stat. 97). </p>

<p>(2) Determined unallowable, then the contracting officer shall assess a penalty in an amount equal to two times the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to the contract. </p>

<p>(d) The contracting officer may waive the penalty provisions when: </p>

<p>(1) The contractor withdraws the submission before the formal initiation of an audit of the submission and submits a revised submission; </p>

<p>(2) The amount of the unallowable costs allocated to covered contracts is $10,000 or less; or </p>

<p>(3) The contractor demonstrates to the contracting officer's satisfaction that: </p>

<p>(i) It has established appropriate policies, personnel training, and an internal control and review system that provides assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from the contractor's submission for settlement of costs; and </p>

<p>(ii) The unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently incorporated into the submission. </p>

<p>(e) The Head of the Contracting Activity may waive the certification when—</p>

<p>(1) It determines that it would be in the best interest of the United States to waive such certification; and </p>

<p>(2) It states in writing the reasons for that determination and makes such determination available to the public. </p>

<p>(a) In the Department of Energy (DOE), overall responsibility for the oversight of the performance of management and operating contractors, including their purchasing activities, rests with the cognizant DOE contracting activity and, in particular, the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA). Contracting officers are responsible for the management and operating contractors' conformance with this subpart and the applicable terms and conditions of their contracts, and for determining whether those purchasing activities provide timely and effective support to DOE programs. </p>

<p>(b) In carrying out their overall responsibilities, HCAs shall— </p>

<p>(1) Require management and operating contractors to maintain written descriptions of their individual purchasing systems and methods and further require that, upon award or extension of the contract, the entire written description be submitted to the contracting officer for review and acceptance; </p>

<p>(2) Require that any changes to the management and operating contractor's written description having any substantive impact upon the contractor's purchasing system and methods be submitted to the contracting officer for review and acceptance prior to issuance; </p>

<p>(3) Ensure the review of individual purchasing actions of certain types, or above stated dollar levels, by the contracting officer pursuant to 48 CFR subpart 44.2 or as set forth in the contractor's approved system and methods; and</p>

<p>(4) Ensure that periodic appraisals of the contractor's management of all facets of the purchasing function, including compliance with the contractor's approved system and methods, are performed by the contracting officer. Such appraisals shall be performed through either of the following methodologies— </p>

<p>(i) Contractor Purchasing System Reviews, conducted in accordance with 48 CFR subpart 44.3; or</p>

<p>(ii) When approved by the contracting officer, contractor participation in the conduct of the Balanced Scorecard performance measurement and performance management system. </p>

<p>(c) In performing the reviews required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2), and the appraisals required by paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection, HCAs shall assure that contracting officers determine that the contractors' written systems and methods are consistent with this subpart and the applicable terms and conditions of their contracts. </p>

<p><a name="P1179_201790"></a><b>970.4401-2   Review and approval.</b></p>

<p>(a) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall establish thresholds, by subcontract type and dollar level, for the review and approval of proposed subcontracting actions by each management and operating contractor under their cognizance. Such thresholds may not exceed the authority delegated to the Head of the Contracting Activity by the Senior Procurement Executive. In establishing these thresholds, the Heads of the Contracting Activities should consider such factors as the following—</p>

<p>(1) The nature of work to be performed under the management and operating contract; </p>

<p>(2) The size, experience, ability, reliability, and organization of the management and operating contractor's purchasing function; </p>

<p>(3) The internal controls, procedures, and organizational stature of the management and operating contractor's purchasing function; and </p>

<p>(4) Policies with respect to such reviews and approvals established by the Senior Procurement Executive. </p>

<p>(b) Prior approval shall be required for the subcontracting of any work a contractor is obligated to perform under a contract entered into under section 41, entitled Production of Special Nuclear Material, of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. </p>

<p>(c) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall take such action as may be required to insure compliance with the procedure for purchasing from contractor-affiliated sources or the purchase of specific items, or classes of items, which by the terms of the contract may require DOE approval. </p>

<p>(d) The Heads of the Contracting Activities may raise or lower the review and approval thresholds established pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection at any time. Such action may be considered upon the periodic review of the contractor's purchasing system, but in any case those adjusted thresholds may not exceed the approval authority delegated to the Head of the Contracting Activity by the Senior Procurement Executive. </p>

<p>(e) DOE approvals of specific proposed purchases pursuant to this subpart shall communicate that such approval does not relieve the management and operating contractor of any obligation under its prime contract with DOE; is given without prejudice to any rights or claims of the Government thereunder; creates no obligation on the part of the Government to the subcontractor, and is not a predetermination of the allowability of costs to be incurred under the subcontract. </p>

<p>(f) Contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contractors establish and maintain subcontract files which contain those documents essential to present an accurate and adequate record of all purchasing transactions. </p>

<p>(g) Contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contractors document purchases in writing, setting forth the information and data used in determining that the purchases are in the best interest of the Government. The scope and detail of this documentation shall be consistent with the nature, dollar value, and complexity of the purchase. </p>

<p>(h) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall assure that the contracting activity establishes and maintains files of the documents associated with the review and approval of subcontract actions subject to DOE review and approval. Those files shall include, among other necessary documentation, an appraisal of the proposed action by the contracting activity and a copy of the approving or disapproving document forwarded to the management and operating contractor, including a listing of any deficiencies, a listing of any required corrective actions, any suggestions, or other relevant comments. </p>

<p>(a) Contracting officers shall assure that the written description of the management and operating contractor's purchasing system and methods provides for advance notice to the DOE contracting officer of the proposed award of the following specified types of subcontracts, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this subsection— </p>

<p>(1) Pursuant to section 304(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Service Act of 1949, as amended (41 U.S.C. 254(b)): </p>

<p>(i) Cost reimbursement-type subcontracts of any award value; and</p>

<p>(ii) Fixed price-type subcontracts which exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, or 5 percent of the total estimated cost of the prime contract. </p>

<p>(2) Purchases from contractor-affiliated sources over a value established by the HCA. </p>

<p>(b) Pursuant to section 602(d)13 of the Act (40 U.S.C. 474(13)) referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the advance notification requirement for the types of purchases listed in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this subsection shall not apply to subcontracts relating to functions derived from the Atomic Energy Commission. </p>

<p>(c) The advance notice shall contain, at a minimum, a description of work, estimated cost, type of contract or reimbursement provisions, and extent of competition, or justification for a noncompetitive purchase procurement. The contracting officer may at any time request additional information that must be furnished promptly and prior to award of the subcontract. </p>

<p><a name="P1203_207080"></a><b>970.4402-1   Policy.</b></p>

<p>(a) DOE contracts for the management and operation of its facilities, the design and production of nuclear weapons, energy research and development, and the performance of other services. These management and operating (M&amp;O) contractors have been selected for their technical and managerial expertise and are expected to bring to bear these technical and managerial skills to accomplish the significant Federal mission(s) described in their contracts with, and work plans approved by, DOE. </p>

<p>(b) Purchasing done by management and operating contractors is one area in which the particular skills of the contractors will be brought to bear in order to more readily accomplish the contractors' assigned missions. The contracting procedures of the contractor's organization, therefore, form the basis for the development of a purchasing system and methods that will comply with its contract with DOE and this subpart. </p>

<p><a name="P1206_208012"></a><b>970.4402-2   General requirements.</b></p>

<p>The following shall apply to the purchasing systems of management and operating contractors: </p>

<p>(a) The objective of a management and operating contractor's purchasing system is to deliver to its customers on a timely basis those best value products and services necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Government's contract. To achieve this objective, contractors are expected to use their experience, expertise and initiative consistent with this subpart. </p>

<p>(b) The purchasing systems and methods used by management and operating contractors shall be well-defined, consistently applied, and shall follow purchasing practices appropriate for the requirement and dollar value of the purchase. It is anticipated that purchasing practices and procedures will vary among contractors and according to the type and kinds of purchases to be made. </p>

<p>(c) Contractor purchases are not Federal procurements, and are not directly subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations in 48 CFR. Nonetheless, certain Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations may affect contractor purchasing, as required by statute, regulation, or contract terms and conditions. </p>

<p>(d) Contractor purchasing systems shall identify and apply the best in commercial purchasing practices and procedures (although nothing precludes the adoption of Federal procurement practices and procedures) to achieve system objectives. Where specific requirements do not otherwise apply, the contractor purchasing system shall provide for appropriate measures to ensure the— </p>

<p>(1) Acquisition of quality products and services at fair and reasonable prices; </p>

<p>(2) Use of capable and reliable subcontractors who either—</p>

<p>(i) Have track records of successful past performance, or</p>

<p>(ii) Can demonstrate a current superior ability to perform; </p>

<p>(3) Minimization of acquisition lead-time and administrative costs of purchasing; </p>

<p>(4) Use of effective competitive techniques; </p>

<p>(5) Reduction of performance risks associated with subcontractors, and facilitation of quality relationships which can include techniques such as partnering agreements, ombudsmen, and alternative disputes procedures; </p>

<p>(6) Use of self-assessment and benchmarking techniques to support continuous improvement in purchasing; </p>

<p>(7) Maintenance of the highest professional and ethical standards; </p>

<p>(8) Maintenance of file documentation appropriate to the value of the purchase and which is adequate to establish the propriety of the transaction and the price paid; and</p>

<p>(9) Maximization of opportunities for small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and woman-owned small business concerns to participate in contract performance. </p>

<p><a name="P1224_210772"></a><b>970.4402-3   Purchasing from contractor-affiliated sources.</b></p>

<p>(a) A management and operating contractor may purchase from sources affiliated with the contractor (any division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the contractor or its parent company) in the same manner as from other sources, provided— </p>

<p>(1) The management and operating contractor's purchasing function is independent of the proposed contractor-affiliated source; </p>

<p>(2) The same terms and conditions would apply if the purchase were from a third party; </p>

<p>(3) Award is made in accordance with policies and procedures designed to permit effective competition which have been approved by the contracting officer. (This requirement for competition shall not preclude acquisition of technical services from contractor-affiliated entities where those entities have a special expertise, and the basis therefore is documented.); and </p>

<p>(4) The award is legally enforceable where the entities are separately incorporated. </p>

<p>(b) Subcontracts for performance of contract work itself (as distinguished from the purchase of supplies and services needed in connection with the performance of work) require DOE authorization and may involve an adjustment of the contractor's fee, if any. If the management and operating contractor seeks authorization to have some part of the contract work performed by a contractor-affiliated source, and that contractor's performance of that work was a factor in the negotiated fee, DOE approval would normally require— </p>

<p>(1) That the contractor-affiliated source perform such work without fee or profit; or </p>

<p>(2) An equitable downward adjustment to the management and operating contractor's fee, if any. </p>

<p>(c) Determination on cost of money allowance as prescribed at 48 CFR 31.225-10 shall be treated as follows: </p>

<p>(a) The Contractor agrees that it shall affirmatively identify, evaluate, and institute practices, where appropriate, that will improve performance in the areas of environmental and health, safety, scientific and technical, security, business and administrative, and any other areas of performance in the management and operation of the contract. This may entail the alteration of existing practices or the institution of new procedures to more effectively or efficiently perform any aspect of contract performance or reduce overall cost of operation under the contract.

<p><b>Work Authorization (MAY 2007)</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Work authorization proposal.</i> Prior to the start of each fiscal year, the Contracting Officer or designee shall provide the Contractor with program execution guidance in sufficient detail to enable the Contractor to develop an estimated cost, scope, and schedule. In addition, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally assign work. The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer or other designated official, a detailed description of work, a budget of estimated costs, and a schedule of performance for the work it recommends be undertaken during that upcoming fiscal year.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Cost estimates.</i> The Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall establish a budget of estimated costs, description of work, and schedule of performance for each work assignment. If agreement cannot be reached as to scope, schedule, and estimated cost, the Contracting Officer may issue a unilateral work authorization, pursuant to this clause. The work authorization, whether issued bilaterally or unilaterally shall become part of the contract. No activities shall be authorized or costs incurred prior to Contracting Officer issuance of a work authorization or direction concerning continuation of activities of the contract.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Performance.</i> The Contractor shall perform work as specified in the work authorization, consistent with the terms and conditions of this contract.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Modification.</i> The Contracting Officer may at any time, without notice, issue changes to work authorizations within the overall scope of the contract. A proposal for adjustment in estimated costs and schedule for performance of work, recognizing work made unnecessary as a result, along with new work, shall be submitted by the Contractor in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause. Resolution shall be in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause.</p>

<p>(e) <i>Increase in estimated cost.</i> The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer immediately whenever the cost incurred, plus the projected cost to complete work is projected to differ (plus or minus) from the estimate by 10 percent. The Contractor shall submit a proposal for modification in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause. Resolution shall be in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause.</p>

<p>(f) <i>Expenditure of funds and incurrence of costs.</i> The expenditure of monies by the Contractor in the performance of all authorized work shall be governed by the “Obligation of Funds” or equivalent clause of the contract.</p>

<p>As prescribed in 970.1504-5(a), insert the following clause. The clause should be tailored to reflect the contract's actual inclusion of base fee amount and performance fee amount. </p>

<p><b>Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount (DEC 2000) </b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Total available fee.</i> Total available fee, consisting of a base fee amount (which may be zero) and a performance fee amount (consisting of an incentive fee component for objective performance requirements, an award fee component for subjective performance requirements, or both) determined in accordance with the provisions of this clause, is available for payment in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled, “Payments and advances.” </p>

<p>(b) <i>Fee negotiations.</i> Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year under this contract, or other appropriate period as mutually agreed upon and, if exceeding one year, approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, the Contracting Officer and Contractor shall enter into negotiation of the requirements for the year or appropriate period, including the evaluation areas and individual requirements subject to incentives, the total available fee, and the allocation of fee. The Contracting Officer shall modify this contract at the conclusion of each negotiation to reflect the negotiated requirements, evaluation areas and individual requirements subject to incentives, the total available fee, and the allocation of fee. In the event the parties fail to agree on the requirements, the evaluation areas and individual requirements subject to incentives, the total available fee, or the allocation of fee, a unilateral determination will be made by the Contracting Officer. The total available fee amount shall be allocated to a twelve month cycle composed of one or more evaluation periods, or such longer period as may be mutually agreed to between the parties and approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. </p>

<p>(c) <i>Determination of total available fee amount earned.</i> (1) The Government shall, at the conclusion of each specified evaluation period, evaluate the Contractor's performance of all requirements, including performance based incentives completed during the period, and determine the total available fee amount earned. At the Contracting Officer's discretion, evaluation of incentivized performance may occur at the scheduled completion of specific incentivized requirements. </p>

<p>(2) The DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, will be (insert title of DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee). The Contractor agrees that the determination as to the total available fee earned is a unilateral determination made by the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee. </p>

<p>(3) The evaluation of Contractor performance shall be in accordance with the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) described in subparagraph (d) of this clause unless otherwise set forth in the contract. The Contractor shall be promptly advised in writing of the fee determination, and the basis of the fee determination. In the event that the Contractor's performance is considered to be less than the level of performance set forth in the Statement of Work, as amended to include the current Work Authorization Directive or similar document, for any contract requirement, it will be considered by the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, who may at his/her discretion adjust the fee determination to reflect such performance. Any such adjustment shall be in accordance with the clause entitled, “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts” if contained in the contract. </p>

<p>(d) <i>Performance evaluation and measurement plan(s).</i> To the extent not set forth elsewhere in the contract: </p>

<p>(1) The Government shall establish a Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) upon which the determination of the total available fee amount earned shall be based. The Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) will address all of the requirements of contract performance specified in the contract directly or by reference. A copy of the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) shall be provided to the Contractor— </p>

<p>(i) Prior to the start of an evaluation period if the requirements, evaluation areas, specific incentives, amount of fee, and allocation of fee to such evaluation areas and specific incentives have been mutually agreed to by the parties; or </p>

<p>(ii) Not later than thirty days prior to the scheduled start date of the evaluation period, if the requirements, evaluation areas, specific incentives, amount of fee, and allocation of fee to such evaluation areas and specific incentives have been unilaterally established by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(2) The Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) will set forth the criteria upon which the Contractor will be evaluated relating to any technical, schedule, management, and/or cost objectives selected for evaluation. Such criteria should be objective, but may also include subjective criteria. The Plan(s) shall also set forth the method by which the total available fee amount will be allocated and the amount earned determined. </p>

<p>(3) The Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) may, consistent with the contract statement of work, be revised during the period of performance. The Contracting Officer shall notify the contractor— </p>

<p>(i) Of such unilateral changes at least ninety calendar days prior to the end of the affected evaluation period and at least thirty calendar days prior to the effective date of the change; </p>

<p>(ii) Of such bilateral changes at least sixty calendar days prior to the end of the affected evaluation period; or </p>

<p>(iii) If such change, whether unilateral or bilateral, is urgent and high priority, at least thirty calendar days prior to the end of the evaluation period.</p>

<p>(e) <i>Schedule for total available fee amount earned determinations.</i> The DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, shall issue the final total available fee amount earned determination in accordance with: the schedule set forth in the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s); or as otherwise set forth in this contract . However, a determination must be made within sixty calendar days after the receipt by the Contracting Officer of the Contractor's self-assessment, if one is required or permitted by paragraph (f) of this clause, or seventy calendar days after the end of the evaluation period, whichever is later, or a longer period if the Contractor and Contracting Officer agree. If the Contracting Officer evaluates the Contractor's performance of specific requirements on their completion, the payment of any earned fee amount must be made within seventy calendar days (or such other time period as mutually agreed to between the Contracting Officer and the Contractor) after such completion. If the determination is delayed beyond that date, the Contractor shall be entitled to interest on the determined total available fee amount earned at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the payment date. This rate is referred to as the “Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,” and is published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest on any late total available fee amount earned determination will accrue daily and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the schedule determination date through the actual date the determination is issued. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the determined amount of fee earned and be subject to interest if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period.</p>

<p>(f) <i>Contractor self-assessment.</i> Following each evaluation period, the Contractor shall submit a self-assessment within (<i>Insert Number</i>) calendar days after the end of the period. This self-assessment shall address both the strengths and weaknesses of the Contractor's performance during the evaluation period. Where deficiencies in performance are noted, the Contractor shall describe the actions planned or taken to correct such deficiencies and avoid their recurrence. The DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, will review the Contractor's self-assessment, if submitted, as part of its independent evaluation of the Contractor's management during the period. A self-assessment, in and of itself may not be the only basis for the award fee determination.</p>

<p><i>Alternate IV</i> (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 970.1504-5(a)(4), when the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, permits the contractor to submit a self-assessment at the contractor's option, add the following text as paragraph (f):</p>

<p>(f) <i>Contractor self-assessment.</i> Following each evaluation period, the Contractor may submit a self-assessment, provided such assessment is submitted within (<i>Insert Number</i>) calendar days after the end of the period. This self-assessment shall address both the strengths and weaknesses of the Contractor's performance during the evaluation period. Where deficiencies in performance are noted, the Contractor shall describe the actions planned or taken to correct such deficiencies and avoid their recurrence. The DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, will review the Contractor's self-assessment, if submitted, as part of its independent evaluation of the Contractor's management during the period.

<p>As prescribed in 970.1504-5(b)(1), insert the following clause:</p>

<p><b>Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts (AUG 2009)</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>General.</i> (1) The payment of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings under this contract is dependent upon— </p>

<p>(i) The Contractor's or Contractor employees' compliance with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to environment, safety and health (ES&amp;H), which includes worker safety and health (WS&amp;H), including performance under an approved Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS); and </p>

<p>(ii) The Contractor's or Contractor employees' compliance with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. </p>

<p>(2) The ES&amp;H performance requirements of this contract are set forth in its ES&amp;H terms and conditions, including the DOE approved contractor ISMS or similar document. Financial incentives for timely mission accomplishment or cost effectiveness shall never compromise or impede full and effective implementation of the ISMS and full ES&amp;H compliance. </p>

<p>(3) The performance requirements of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information are set forth in the clauses of this contract entitled, “Security” and “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives,” as well as in other terms and conditions. </p>

<p>(4) If the Contractor does not meet the performance requirements of this contract relating to ES&amp;H or to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information during any performance evaluation period established under the contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled, “Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount,” otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit or share of cost savings may be unilaterally reduced by the contracting officer. </p>

<p>(b) <i>Reduction amount.</i> (1) The amount of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings that may be unilaterally reduced will be determined by the severity of the performance failure pursuant to the degrees specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this clause. </p>

<p>(2) If a reduction of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings is warranted, unless mitigating factors apply, such reduction shall not be less than 26 percent nor greater than 100 percent of the amount of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or the Contractor's share of cost savings for a first degree performance failure, not less than 11 percent nor greater than 25 percent for a second degree performance failure, and up to 10 percent for a third degree performance failure. </p>

<p>(3) In determining the amount of the reduction and the applicability of mitigating factors, the contracting officer must consider the Contractor's overall performance in meeting the ES&amp;H or security requirements of the contract. Such consideration must include performance against any site specific performance criteria/requirements that provide additional definition, guidance for the amount of reduction, or guidance for the applicability of mitigating factors. In all cases, the contracting officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range (see 48 CFR 970.1504-1-2). The mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the following ((v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) apply to ES&amp;H only). </p>

<p>(i) Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident. </p>

<p>(ii) Efforts the Contractor had made to anticipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance. </p>

<p>(iii) Contractor self-identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence. </p>

<p>(iv) General status (trend and absolute performance) of: ES&amp;H and compliance in related areas; or of safeguarding Restricted Data and other classified information and compliance in related areas. </p>

<p>(v) Contractor demonstration to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the principles of industrial ES&amp;H standards are routinely practiced (e.g., Voluntary Protection Program, ISO 14000). </p>

<p>(vi) Event caused by “Good Samaritan” act by the Contractor (e.g., offsite emergency response). </p>

<p>(vii) Contractor demonstration that a performance measurement system is routinely used to improve and maintain ES&amp;H performance (including effective resource allocation) and to support DOE corporate decision-making (e.g., policy, ES&amp;H programs). *&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* </p>

<p>(viii) Contractor demonstration that an Operating Experience and Feedback Program is functioning that demonstrably affects continuous improvement in ES&amp;H by use of lessons-learned and best practices inter- and intra-DOE sites. </p>

<p>(4)(i) The amount of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings that is otherwise earned by a contractor during an evaluation period may be reduced in accordance with this clause if it is determined that a performance failure warranting a reduction under this clause occurs within the evaluation period. </p>

<p>(ii) The amount of reduction under this clause, in combination with any reduction made under any other clause in the contract, shall not exceed the amount of fee, fixed fee, profit, or the Contractor's share of cost savings that is otherwise earned during the evaluation period. </p>

<p>(iii) For the purposes of this clause, earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings for the evaluation period shall mean the amount determined by the Contracting Officer or fee determination official as otherwise payable based on the Contractor's performance during the evaluation period. Where the contract provides for financial incentives that extend beyond a single evaluation period, this amount shall also include: any provisional amounts determined otherwise payable in the evaluation period; and, if provisional payments are not provided for, the allocable amount of any incentive determined otherwise payable at the conclusion of a subsequent evaluation period. The allocable amount shall be the total amount of the earned incentive divided by the number of evaluation periods over which it was earned.</p>

<p>(iv) The Government will effect the reduction as soon as practicable after the end of the evaluation period in which the performance failure occurs. If the Government is not aware of the failure, it will effect the reduction as soon as practical after becoming aware. For any portion of the reduction requiring an allocation the Government will effect the reduction at the end of the evaluation period in which it determines the total amount earned under the incentive. If at any time a reduction causes the sum of the payments the Contractor has received for fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings to exceed the sum of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings the Contractor has earned (provisionally or otherwise), the Contractor shall immediately return the excess to the Government. (What the Contractor “has earned” reflects any reduction made under this or any other clause of the contract.) </p>

<p>(v) At the end of the contract— </p>

<p>(A) The Government will pay the Contractor the amount by which the sum of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings the Contractor has earned exceeds the sum of the payments the Contractor has received; or </p>

<p>(B) The Contractor shall return to the Government the amount by which the sum of the payments the Contractor has received exceeds the sum of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings the Contractor has earned. (What the Contractor “has earned” reflects any reduction made under this or any other clause of the contract.) </p>

<p>(c) <i>Environment, Safety and Health (ES&amp;H).</i> Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the contract's ES&amp;H terms and conditions, including the DOE approved Contractor ISMS. The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of earned or fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings will be determined are: </p>

<p>(1) <i>First Degree:</i> Performance failures that are most adverse to ES&amp;H. Failure to develop and obtain required DOE approval of an ISMS is considered first degree. The Government will perform necessary review of the ISMS in a timely manner and will not unreasonably withhold approval of the Contractor's ISMS. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered first degree. </p>

<p>(i) Type A accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1B, or successor version). </p>

<p>(ii) Two Second Degree performance failures during an evaluation period. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Second Degree:</i> Performance failures that are significantly adverse to ES&amp;H. They include failures to comply with an approved ISMS that result in an actual injury, exposure, or exceedence that occurred or nearly occurred but had minor practical long-term health consequences. They also include breakdowns of the Safety Management System. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered second degree: </p>

<p>(i) Type B accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1B, or successor version). </p>

<p>(ii) Non-compliance with an approved ISMS that results in a near miss of a Type A or B accident. A near miss is a situation in which an inappropriate action occurs, or a necessary action is omitted, but does not result in an adverse effect. </p>

<p>(iii) Failure to mitigate or notify DOE of an imminent danger situation after discovery, where such notification is a requirement of the contract. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Third Degree:</i> Performance failures that reflect a lack of focus on improving ES&amp;H. They include failures to comply with an approved ISMS that result in potential breakdown of the System. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree: </p>

<p>(i) Failure to implement effective corrective actions to address deficiencies/non-compliances documented through: external (e.g., Federal) oversight and/or reported per DOE Order 232.1-2 requirements; or internal oversight of DOE Order 440.1A requirements. </p>

<p>(ii) Multiple similar non-compliances identified by external (e.g., Federal) oversight that in aggregate indicate a significant programmatic breakdown. </p>

<p>(iii) Non-compliances that either have, or may have, significant negative impacts to the worker, the public, or the environment or that indicate a significant programmatic breakdown. </p>

<p>(iv) Failure to notify DOE upon discovery of events or conditions where notification is required by the terms and conditions of the contract. </p>

<p>(d) <i>Safeguarding restricted data and other classified information.</i> Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of fee, profit, or share of cost savings will be determined are as follows: </p>

<p>(1) <i>First Degree:</i> Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, DOE regulation, or directive, to have resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, exceptionally grave damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered first degree: </p>

<p>(i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating a risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a Special Access Program (SAP), information identified as sensitive compartmented information (SCI), or high risk nuclear weapons-related data. </p>

<p>(ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data. </p>

<p>(iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data. </p>

<p>(iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Second Degree:</i> Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, DOE regulation, or directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, serious damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered second degree: </p>

<p>(i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret. </p>

<p>(ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Secret. </p>

<p>(iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other classified information regardless of classification (except for information covered by paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this clause). </p>

<p>(iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other classified information classified as Secret. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Third Degree:</i> Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, undue risk to the common defense and security. In addition, this category includes performance failures that result from a lack of Contractor management and/or employee attention to the proper safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. These performance failures may be indicators of future, more severe performance failures and/or conditions, and if identified and corrected early would prevent serious incidents. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered third degree: </p>

<p>(i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other information classified as Confidential. </p>

<p>(ii) Failure to promptly report alleged or suspected violations of laws, regulations, or directives pertaining to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information. </p>

<p>(iii) Failure to identify or timely execute corrective actions to mitigate or eliminate identified vulnerabilities and reduce residual risk relating to the protection of Restricted Data or other classified information in accordance with the Contractor's Safeguards and Security Plan or other security plan, as applicable. </p>

<p>(iv) Contractor actions that result in performance failures which unto themselves pose minor risk, but when viewed in the aggregate indicate degradation in the integrity of the Contractor's safeguards and security management system relating to the protection of Restricted Data and other classified information.</p>

<p><a name="P1486_278760"></a><b>970.5215-4   Cost reduction.</b></p>

<p>As prescribed in 970.1504-5(c), insert the following clause:</p>

<p><b>Cost Reduction (AUG 2009)</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>General.</i> It is the Department of Energy's (DOE's) intent to have its facilities and laboratories operated in an efficient and effective manner. To this end, the Contractor shall assess its operations and identify areas where cost reductions would bring cost efficiency to operations without adversely affecting the level of performance required by the contract. The Contractor, to the maximum extent practical, shall identify areas where cost reductions may be effected, and develop and submit Cost Reduction Proposals (CRPs) to the Contracting Officer. If accepted, the Contractor may share in any shared net savings from accepted CRPs in accordance with paragraph (g) of this clause.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Definitions. Administrative cost</i> is the Contractor cost of developing and administering the CRP.</p>

<p><i>Design, process, or method change</i> is a change to a design, process, or method which has established cost, technical and schedule baseline, is defined, and is subject to a formal control procedure. Such a change must be innovative, initiated by the Contractor, and applied to a specific project or program.</p>

<p><i>Development cost</i> is the Contractor cost of up-front planning, engineering, prototyping, and testing of a design, process, or method.</p>

<p><i>DOE cost</i> is the Government cost incurred implementing and validating the CRP.</p>

<p><i>Implementation cost</i> is the Contractor cost of tooling, facilities, documentation, etc., required to effect a design, process, or method change once it has been tested and approved.</p>

<p><i>Net Savings</i> means a reduction in the total amount (to include all related costs and fee) of performing the effort where the savings revert to DOE control and may be available for deobligation. Such savings may result from a specific cost reduction effort which is negotiated on a cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, or firm-fixed-price basis, or may result directly from a design, process, or method change. They may also be savings resulting from formal or informal direction given by DOE or from changes in the mission, work scope, or routine reorganization of the Contractor due to changes in the budget.</p>

<p><i>Shared Net Savings</i> are those net savings which result from—</p>

<p>(1) A specific cost reduction effort which is negotiated on a cost-plus-incentive-fee or fixed-price incentive basis, and is the difference between the negotiated target cost of performing an effort as negotiated and the actual allowable cost of performing that effort; or</p>

<p>(2) A design, process, or method change, which occurs in the fiscal year in which the change is accepted and the subsequent fiscal year, and is the difference between the estimated cost of performing an effort as originally planned and the actual allowable cost of performing that same effort utilizing a revised plan intended to reduce costs along with any Contractor development costs, implementation costs, administrative costs, and DOE costs associated with the revised plan. Administrative costs and DOE costs are only included at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Savings resulting from formal or informal direction given by the DOE or changes in the mission, work scope, or routine reorganization of the Contractor due to changes in the budget are not to be considered as shared net savings for purposes of this clause and do not qualify for incentive sharing.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Procedure for submission of CRPs.</i> (1) CRPs for the establishment of cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, or firm-fixed-price efforts or for design, process, or methods changes submitted by the Contractor shall contain, at a minimum, the following:</p>

<p>(i) Current Method (Baseline)—A verifiable description of the current scope of work, cost, and schedule to be impacted by the initiative, and supporting documentation.</p>

<p>(ii) New Method (New Proposed Baseline)—A verifiable description of the new scope of work, cost, and schedule, how the initiative will be accomplished, and supporting documentation.</p>

<p>(iii) Feasibility Assessment—A description and evaluation of the proposed initiative and benefits, risks, and impacts of implementation. This evaluation shall include an assessment of the difference between the current method (baseline) and proposed new method including all related costs.</p>

<p>(2) In addition, CRPs for the establishment of cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, or firm-fixed-price efforts shall contain, at a minimum, the following—</p>

<p>(i) The proposed contractual arrangement and the justification for its use; and</p>

<p>(ii) A detailed cost/price estimate and supporting rationale. If the approach is proposed on an incentive basis, minimum and maximum cost estimates should be included along with any proposed sharing arrangements.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Evaluation and decision.</i> All CRPs must be submitted to and approved by the Contracting Officer. Included in the information provided by the CRP must be a discussion of the extent the proposed cost reduction effort may—</p>

<p>(1) Pose a risk to the health and safety of workers, the community, or to the environment;</p>

<p>(2) Result in a waiver or deviation from DOE requirements, such as DOE Orders and joint oversight agreements;</p>

<p>(3) Require a change in other contractual agreements; </p>

<p>(4) Result in significant organizational and personnel impacts; </p>

<p>(5) Create a negative impact on the cost, schedule, or scope of work in another area; </p>

<p>(6) Pose a potential negative impact on the credibility of the Contractor or the DOE; and</p>

<p>(7) Impact successful and timely completion of any of the work in the cost, technical, and schedule baseline. </p>

<p>(e) <i>Acceptance or rejection of CRPs.</i> Acceptance or rejection of a CRP is a unilateral determination made by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor that a CRP has been accepted, rejected, or deferred within (<i>Insert Number</i>) days of receipt. The only CRPs that will be considered for acceptance are those which the Contractor can demonstrate, at a minimum, will—</p>

<p>(1) Result in net savings (in the sharing period if a design, process, or method change); </p>

<p>(2) Not reappear as costs in subsequent periods; and</p>

<p>(3) Not result in any impairment of essential functions. </p>

<p>(f) The failure of the Contracting Officer to notify the Contractor of the acceptance, rejection, or deferral of a CRP within the specified time shall not be construed as approval.</p>

<p>(g) <i>Adjustment to original estimated cost and fee.</i> If a CRP is established on a cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive or firm-fixed-price basis, the originally estimated cost and fee for the total effort shall be adjusted to remove the estimated cost and fee amount associated with the CRP effort.</p>

<p>(h) <i>Sharing arrangement.</i> If a CRP is accepted, the Contractor may share in the shared net savings. For a CRP negotiated on a cost-plus-incentive-fee or fixed-price incentive basis, with the specific incentive arrangement (negotiated target costs, target fees, share lines, ceilings, profit, etc.) set forth in the contractual document authorizing the effort, the Contractor's share shall be the actual fee or profit resulting from such an arrangement. For a CRP negotiated as a cost savings incentive resulting from a design, process, or method change, the Contractor's share shall be a percentage, not to exceed 25% of the shared net savings. The specific percentage and sharing period shall be set forth in the contractual document.</p>

<p>(i) <i>Validation of Shared Net Savings.</i> The Contracting Officer shall validate actual shared net savings. If actual shared net savings cannot be validated, the Contractor will not be entitled to a share of the net shared savings.</p>

<p>(j) <i>Relationship to other incentives.</i> Only those benefits of an accepted CRP not awardable under other clauses of this contract shall be considered under this clause.</p>

<p>(k) <i>Subcontracts.</i> The Contractor may include a clause similar to this clause in any subcontract. In calculating any estimated shared net savings in a CRP under this contract, the Contractor's administration, development, and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor's allowable costs, and any CRP incentive payments to a subcontractor resulting from the acceptance of such CRP. The Contractor may choose any arrangement for subcontractor CRP incentive payments, provided that the payments not reduce the DOE's share of shared net savings.</p>

<p>(g) The Contractor shall promptly evaluate and resolve any noncompliance with applicable ES&amp;H requirements and the System. If the Contractor fails to provide resolution or if, at any time, the Contractor's acts or failure to act causes substantial harm or an imminent danger to the environment or health and safety of employees or the public, the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping work in whole or in part. Any stop work order issued by a contracting officer under this clause (or issued by the Contractor to a subcontractor in accordance with paragraph (i) of this clause) shall be without prejudice to any other legal or contractual rights of the Government. In the event that the Contracting Officer issues a stop work order, an order authorizing the resumption of the work may be issued at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time or additional fee or damages by reason of, or in connection with, any work stoppage ordered in accordance with this clause. </p>

<p>(h) Regardless of the performer of the work, the Contractor is responsible for compliance with the ES&amp;H requirements applicable to this contract. The Contractor is responsible for flowing down the ES&amp;H requirements applicable to this contract to subcontracts at any tier to the extent necessary to ensure the Contractor's compliance with the requirements. </p>

<p>(i) The Contractor shall include a clause substantially the same as this clause in subcontracts involving complex or hazardous work on site at a DOE-owned or -leased facility. Such subcontracts shall provide for the right to stop work under the conditions described in paragraph (g) of this clause.

<p>As prescribed in 970.2571-3, use the following clause:</p>

<p><b>COMPLIANCE WITH EXPORT CONTROL LAWS AND REGULATIONS (NOV 2015)</b></p>

<p>(a) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable U.S. export control laws and regulations.</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>

<p>(c) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds to, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations, including but not limited to—</p>

<p>(1) The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended;</p>

<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 <i>et seq.</i>);</p>

<p>(9) Regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (31 CFR parts 500 through 598).</p>

<p>(d) In addition to the Federal laws and regulations cited above, National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189, National Policy on the Transfer of Scientific, Technical, and Engineering Information establishes a national policy that, to the maximum extent possible, the products of fundamental research shall remain unrestricted. NSDD 189 provides that no restrictions may be placed upon the conduct or reporting of federally funded fundamental research that has not received national security classification, except as provided in applicable U.S. statutes. As a result, contracts confined to the performance of unclassified fundamental research generally do not involve any export-controlled activities.</p>

<p>NSDD 189 does not take precedence over statutes. NSDD 189 does not exempt any research from statutes that apply to export controls such as the Atomic Energy Act, as amended; the Arms Export Control Act; the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended; or the U.S. International Emergency Economic Powers Act; or the regulations that implement those statutes (<i>e.g.,</i> the ITAR, the EAR, 10 CFR part 110 and 10 CFR part 810). Thus, if items (<i>e.g.,</i> commodities, software or technologies) that are controlled by U.S. export control laws or regulations are used to conduct research or are generated as part of the research efforts, the export control laws and regulations apply to the controlled items.</p>

<p><b>(End of notice) </b></p>

<p>(3) The title to the copyright of the original of unclassified graduate theses and the original of related unclassified scientific papers shall vest in the author thereof, subject to the right of DOE to retain duplicates of such documents and to use such documents for any purpose whatsoever without any claim on the part of the author or the contractor for additional compensation. </p>

<p>(e) <i>Copyrighted works (other than scientific and technical articles and data produced under a CRADA).</i> The Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subsisting in technical data and computer software first produced by the Contractor in performance of this Contract, where the Contractor can show that commercialization would be enhanced by such copyright protection, subject to the following: </p>

<p>(1) Contractor Request to Assert Copyright. </p>

<p>(i) For data other than scientific and technical articles and data produced under a CRADA, the Contractor shall submit in writing to Patent Counsel its request to assert copyright in data first produced in the performance of this Contract pursuant to this clause. The right of the Contractor to copyright data first produced under a CRADA is as described in the individual CRADA. Each request by the Contractor must include: </p>

<p>(A) The identity of the data (including any computer program) for which the Contractor requests permission to assert copyright, as well as an abstract which is descriptive of the data and is suitable for dissemination purposes, (B) The program under which it was funded, (C) Whether, to the best knowledge of the Contractor, the data is subject to an international treaty or agreement, (D) Whether the data is subject to export control, (E) A statement that the Contractor plans to commercialize the data in compliance with the clause of this contract entitled, “Technology Transfer Mission,” within five (5) years after obtaining permission to assert copyright or, on a case-by-case basis, a specified longer period where the Contractor can demonstrate that the ability to commercialize effectively is dependent upon such longer period, and (F) For data other than computer software, a statement explaining why the assertion of copyright is necessary to enhance commercialization and is consistent with DOE's dissemination responsibilities. </p>

<p>(ii) For data that is developed using other funding sources in addition to DOE funding, the permission to assert copyright in accordance with this clause must also be obtained by the Contractor from all other funding sources prior to the Contractor's request to Patent Counsel. The request shall include the Contractor's certification or other documentation acceptable to Patent Counsel demonstrating such permission has been obtained. </p>

<p>(iii) Permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in excepted categories of data as determined by DOE will be expressly withheld. Such excepted categories include data whose release (A) would be detrimental to national security, i.e., involve classified information or data or sensitive information under Section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or are subject to export control for nonproliferation and other nuclear-related national security purposes, (B) would not enhance the appropriate transfer or dissemination and commercialization of such data, (C) would have a negative impact on U.S. industrial competitiveness, (D) would prevent DOE from meeting its obligations under treaties and international agreements, or (E) would be detrimental to one or more of DOE's programs. Additional excepted categories may be added by the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property. Where data are determined to be under export control restriction, the Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subject to the provisions of this clause for purposes of limited commercialization in a manner that complies with export control statutes and applicable regulations. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, all data developed with Naval Reactors' funding and those data that are classified fall within excepted categories. The rights of the Contractor in data are subject to the disposition of data rights in the treaties and international agreements identified under this Contract as well as those additional treaties and international agreements which DOE may from time to time identify by unilateral amendment to the Contract; such amendment listing added treaties and international agreements is effective only for data which is developed after the date such treaty or international agreement is added to this Contract. Also, the Contractor will not be permitted to assert copyright in data in the form of various technical reports generated by the Contractor under the Contract without first obtaining the advanced written permission of the contracting officer. </p>

<p>(2) DOE Review and Response to Contractor's Request. The Patent Counsel shall use its best efforts to respond in writing within 90 days of receipt of a complete request by the Contractor to assert copyright in technical data and computer software pursuant to this clause. Such response shall either give or withhold DOE's permission for the Contractor to assert copyright or advise the Contractor that DOE needs additional time to respond, and the reasons therefor.</p>

<p>(3) Permission for Contractor to Assert Copyright. </p>

<p>(i) For computer software, the Contractor shall furnish to the DOE designated, centralized software distribution and control point, the Energy Science and Technology Software Center, at the time permission to assert copyright is given under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause: (A) An abstract describing the software suitable for publication, (B) the source code for each software program, and (C) the object code and at least the minimum support documentation needed by a technically competent user to understand and use the software. The Patent Counsel, for good cause shown by the Contractor, may allow the minimum support documentation to be delivered within 60 days after permission to assert copyright is given or at such time the minimum support documentation becomes available. The Contractor acknowledges that the DOE designated software distribution and control point may provide a technical description of the software in an announcement identifying its availability from the copyright holder. </p>

<p>(ii) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, for data other than computer software to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause above, the Contractor shall within sixty (60) days of obtaining such permission furnish to DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) a copy of such data as well as an abstract of the data suitable for dissemination purposes. The Contractor acknowledges that OSTI may provide an abstract of the data in an announcement to DOE, its contractors and to the public identifying its availability from the copyright holder. </p>

<p>(iii) For a five year period or such other specified period as specifically approved by Patent Counsel beginning on the date the Contractor is given permission to assert copyright in data, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. Upon request, the initial period may be extended after DOE approval. The DOE approval will be based on the standard that the work is still commercially available and the market demand is being met. </p>

<p>(iv) After the period approved by Patent Counsel for application of the limited Government license described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this clause, or if, prior to the end of such period(s), the Contractor abandons commercialization activities pertaining to the data to which the Contractor has been given permission to assert copyright, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, distribute copies to the public, prepare derivative works, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. </p>

<p>(v) Whenever the Contractor asserts copyright in data pursuant to this paragraph (e), the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 on the copyrighted data and also an acknowledgment of the Government sponsorship and license rights of paragraphs (e)(3) (iii) and (iv) of this clause. Such action shall be taken when the data are delivered to the Government, published, licensed or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. The acknowledgment of Government sponsorship and license rights shall be as follows: Notice: These data were produced by (insert name of Contractor) under Contract No. _______ with the Department of Energy. For (period approved by DOE Patent Counsel) from (date permission to assert copyright was obtained), the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. There is provision for the possible extension of the term of this license. Subsequent to that period or any extension granted, the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. The specific term of the license can be identified by inquiry made to Contractor or DOE. Neither the United States nor the United States Department of Energy, nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, express or implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any data , apparatus, product, or process disclosed, or represents that its use would not infringe privately owned rights. </p>

<p><b>(End of notice) </b></p>

<p>(vi) With respect to any data to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright, the DOE has the right, during the five (5) year or specified longer period approved by Patent Counsel as provided for in paragraph (e) of this clause, to request the Contractor to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant(s) upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Contractor refuses such request, to grant such license itself, if the DOE determines that the Contractor has not made a satisfactory demonstration that either it or its licensee(s) is actively pursuing commercialization of the data as set forth in subparagraph (e)(1)(A) of this clause. Before licensing under this subparagraph (vi), DOE shall furnish the Contractor a written request for the Contractor to grant the stated license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days (or such longer period as may be authorized by the contracting officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor) after such notice to show cause why the license should not be granted. The Contractor shall have the right to appeal the decision of the DOE to grant the stated license to the Invention Licensing Appeal Board as set forth in 10 CFR 781.65—”Appeals.” </p>

<p>(vii) No costs shall be allowable for maintenance of copyrighted data, primarily for the benefit of the Contractor and/or a licensee which exceeds DOE Program needs, except as expressly provided in writing by the contracting officer. The Contractor may use its net royalty income to effect such maintenance costs. </p>

<p>(viii) At any time the Contractor abandons commercialization activities for data for which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright in accordance with this clause, it shall advise OSTI and Patent Counsel and upon request assign the copyright to the Government so that the Government can distribute the data to the public. </p>

<p>(4) The following notice may be placed on computer software prior to any publication and prior to the Contractor's obtaining permission from the Department of Energy to assert copyright in the computer software pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section. </p>

<p>Notice: This computer software was prepared by [insert the Contractor's name and the individual author], hereinafter the Contractor, under Contract [insert the Contract Number] with the Department of Energy (DOE). All rights in the computer software are reserved by DOE on behalf of the United States Government and the Contractor as provided in the Contract. You are authorized to use this computer software for Governmental purposes but it is not to be released or distributed to the public.

<p>(ii) Unless otherwise expressly approved by the contracting officer in advance for a specific CRADA, the Contractor agrees, at the request of the contracting officer, to transmit such data to other DOE facilities for use by DOE or its Contractors by or on behalf of the Government. When data protected pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this clause is so transferred, the Contractor shall clearly mark the data with a legend setting out the restrictions against private use and further dissemination, along with the expiration date of such restrictions. </p>

<p>(iii) In addition to its authority to license Intellectual Property, the Contractor may enter into licensing agreements with third parties for data developed by the Contractor under a CRADA subject to other provisions of this Contract. However, the Contractor shall neither use the protection against dissemination nor the licensing of data as an alternative to the submittal of invention disclosures which include data protected pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this clause. </p>

<p>(4) <i>Strategic Partnership Projects and user facility programs.</i> (i) SPP and User Facility Agreements (UFAs) are not CRADAs and will be available for use by the Contractor in addition to CRADAs for achieving utilization of employee expertise and unique facilities for maximizing technology transfer. The Contractor agrees form prospective CRADA participants, which are intending to substantially pay full cost recovery for the effort under a proposed CRADA, of the availability of alternative forms of agreements, i.e., SPP and UFA, and of the Class Patent Waiver provisions associated therewith. </p>

<p>(ii) Where the Contractor believes that the transfer of technology to the U.S. domestic economy will benefit from, or other equity considerations dictate, an arrangement other than the Class Waiver of patent rights to the sponsor in SPP and UFAs, a request may be made to the contracting officer for an exception to the Class Waivers. </p>

<p>(iii) Rights to inventions made under agreements other than funding agreements with third parties shall be governed by the appropriate provisions incorporated, with DOE approval, in such agreements, and the provisions in such agreements take precedence over any disposition of rights contained in this Contract. Disposition of rights under any such agreement shall be in accordance with any DOE class waiver (including Strategic Partnership Projects and User Class Waivers) or individually negotiated waiver which applies to the agreement. </p>

<p>(5) <i>Conflicts of interest.</i> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (n)(5)(iii) of this clause, the Contractor shall assure that no employee of the Contractor shall have a substantial role (including an advisory role) in the preparation, negotiation, or approval of a CRADA, if, to such employee's knowledge: </p>

<p>(A) Such employee, or the spouse, child, parent, sibling, or partner of such employee, or an organization (other than the Contractor) in which such employee serves as an officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee—</p>

<p>(<i>1</i>) Holds financial interest in any entity, other than the Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the preparation, negotiation, or approval of the CRADA; </p>

<p>(<i>2</i>) Receives a gift or gratuity from any entity, other than the Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the preparation, negotiation, or approval of the CRADA; or </p>

<p>(B) A financial interest in any entity, other than the Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the preparation, negotiation, or approval of the CRADA, is held by any person or organization with whom such employee is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment. </p>

<p>(ii) The Contractor shall require that each employee of the Contractor who has a substantial role (including an advisory role) in the preparation, negotiation, or approval of a CRADA certify through the Contractor to the contracting officer that the circumstances described in paragraph (n)(5)(i) of this clause do not apply to that employee. </p>

<p>(iii) The requirements of paragraphs (n)(5)(i) and (n)(5)(ii) of this clause shall not apply in a case where the contracting officer is advised by the Contractor in advance of the participation of an employee described in those paragraphs in the preparation, negotiation or approval of a CRADA of the nature of and extent of any financial interest described in paragraph (n)(5)(i) of this clause, and the contracting officer determines that such financial interest is not so substantial as to be considered likely to affect the integrity of the Contractor employee's participation in the process of preparing, negotiating, or approving the CRADA. </p>

<p>(o) <i>Technology transfer in other cost-sharing agreements.</i> In conducting research and development activities in cost-shared agreements not covered by paragraph (n) of this clause, the Contractor, with prior written permission of the contracting officer, may provide for the withholding of data produced thereunder in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (n)(3) of this clause.</p>

<p>(c) The term “royalties” as used in this clause refers to any costs or charges in the nature of royalties, license fees, patent or license amortization costs, or the like, for the use of or for rights in patents and patent applications that are used in the performance of this contract or any subcontract hereunder. </p>

<p>(d) The Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer, annually upon request, a statement of royalties paid or required to be paid in connection with performing this Contract and subcontracts hereunder. </p>

<p>(e) For royalty payments under licenses entered into after the effective date of this Contract, costs incurred for royalties proposed under this paragraph shall be allowable only to the extent that such royalties are approved by the Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer determines that existing or proposed royalty payments are inappropriate, any payments subsequent to such determination shall be allowable only to the extent approved by the Contracting Officer. </p>

<p>(f) Regardless of prior DOE approval of any individual payments or royalties, DOE may contest at any time the enforceability, validity, scope of, or title to a patent for which the Contractor makes a royalty or other payment. </p>

<p>(g) If at any time within 3 years after final payment under this contract, the Contractor for any reason is relieved in whole or in part from the payment of any royalties to which this clause applies, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of that fact and shall promptly reimburse the Government for any refunds received or royalties paid after having received notice of such relief. </p>

<p>(h) The Contractor agrees to include, and require inclusion of, this clause, including this paragraph (h), suitably modified to identify the parties in any subcontract at any tier in which the amount of royalties reported during negotiation of the subcontract exceeds $250.</p>

The rights assigned to the Contractor are subject to any provision of this clause that is applicable to subject inventions in which the Contractor retains title, including reservation by the Government of a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license, except that the Contractor shall file its initial patent application claiming the subject invention or exceptional circumstance invention within one (1) year after the assignment of such rights. The Contractor shall share royalties collected for the manufacture, use or sale of the subject invention with the Government employee. </p>

<p>(c) <i>Subject invention disclosure, election of title and filing of patent application by contractor</i>—(1) <i>Subject invention disclosure.</i> The contractor will disclose each subject invention to the Patent Counsel within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and the inventor(s) and all sources of funding by B&amp;R code for the invention. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. The disclosure shall include a written statement as to whether the invention falls within an exceptional circumstance field.

In addition, after disclosure to the Patent Counsel, the Contractor will promptly notify the agency of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the contractor. The Contractor shall obtain approval from Patent Counsel prior to any release or publication of information concerning any nonelectable subject invention such as an exceptional circumstance subject invention or any subject invention related to a treaty or international agreement. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Election by the Contractor.</i> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Contractor will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying the Federal agency within two years of disclosure to the Federal agency. However, in any case where publication, on sale or public use has initiated the one year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by the agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Filing of patent applications by the Contractor.</i> The Contractor will file its initial patent application on a subject invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if earlier, or prior to the end of any 1-year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Contractor will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either ten months of the corresponding initial patent application or six months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order. </p>

<p>(4) <i>Contractor's request for an extension of time.</i> Requests for an extension of the time for disclosure, election, and filing under subparagraphs (c)(1), (2) and (3) may, at the discretion of Patent Counsel, be granted. </p>

<p>(5) <i>Publication approval.</i> During the course of the work under this contract, the Contractor or its employees may desire to release or publish information regarding scientific or technical developments conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract. In order that public disclosure of such information will not adversely affect the patent interest of DOE or the Contractor, approval for release or publication shall be secured from the Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters prior to any such release or publication. Where DOE's approval of publication is requested, DOE's response to such requests for approval shall normally be provided within 90 days except in circumstances in which a domestic patent application must be filed in order to protect foreign rights. In the case involving foreign patent rights, DOE shall be granted an additional 180 days with which to respond to the request for approval, unless extended by mutual agreement. </p>

<p>(d) <i>Conditions when the Government may obtain title.</i> The Contractor will convey to the DOE, upon written request, title to any subject invention—</p>

<p>(1) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect title to the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, or elects not to retain title; provided, that DOE may only request title within sixty (60) days after learning of the failure of the Contractor to disclose or to elect within the specified times. </p>

<p>(2) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file a patent application within the times specified in subparagraph (c) of this clause; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in subparagraph (c) above, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the DOE, the Contractor shall continue to retain title in that country. </p>

<p>(3) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention. </p>

<p>(4) If the Contractor requests that DOE acquire title or rights from the Contractor in a subject invention to which the Contractor had initially retained title or rights, or in an exceptional circumstance subject invention to which the Contractor was granted greater rights, DOE may acquire such title or rights from the Contractor, or DOE may decide against acquiring such title or rights from the Contractor, at DOE's sole discretion. </p>

<p>(e) <i>Minimum rights of the Contractor and protection of the Contractor's right to file</i>—(1) <i>Request for a Contractor license.</i> The Contractor may request the right to reserve a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the Contractor fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. DOE may grant or refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor. When DOE approves such reservation, the Contractor's license will normally extend to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business to which the invention pertains. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Revocation or modification of a Contractor license.</i> The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR Part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR Part 781. This license will not be revoked in the field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the subject invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application of the subject invention in that foreign country. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Notice of revocation of modification of a Contractor license.</i> Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781 concerning the licensing of Government owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license. </p>

<p>(f) <i>Contractor action to protect the Government's interest</i>—(1) <i>Execution of delivery of title or license instruments.</i> The Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed, and promptly deliver to the Patent Counsel all instruments necessary to accomplish the following actions: </p>

<p>(i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions to which the Contractor elects to retain title, and</p>

<p>(ii) Convey title to DOE when requested under subparagraphs (b) or paragraph (d) of this clause and to enable the Government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Contractor employee agreements.</i> The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to Contractor personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor, each subject invention made under this contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Notification of discontinuation of patent protection.</i> The contractor will notify the Patent Counsel of any decision not to continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than thirty days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office. </p>

<p>(4) <i>Notification of Government rights.</i> The contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent applications and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement, “This invention was made with government support under (identify the contract) awarded by (identify the Federal agency). The government has certain rights in the invention.” </p>

<p>(5) <i>Invention identification procedures.</i> The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to ensure that subject inventions are promptly identified and timely disclosed and shall submit a written description of such procedures to the Contracting Officer so that the Contracting Officer may evaluate and determine their effectiveness. </p>

<p>(6) <i>Invention filing documentation.</i> If the Contractor files a domestic or foreign patent application claiming a subject invention, the Contractor shall promptly submit to Patent Counsel, upon request, the following information and documents: </p>

<p>(i) The filing date, serial number, title, and a copy of the patent application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English); </p>

<p>(ii) An executed and approved instrument fully confirmatory of all Government rights in the subject invention; and</p>

<p>(iii) The patent number, issue date, and a copy of any issued patent claiming the subject invention. </p>

<p>(7) <i>Duplication and disclosure of documents.</i> The Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause; provided, however, that any such duplication or disclosure by the Government is subject to the confidentiality provision at 35 U.S.C. 205 and 37 CFR part 40. </p>

<p>(g) <i>Subcontracts</i>—(1) <i>Subcontractor subject inventions.</i> The Contractor shall not obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions as part of the consideration for awarding a subcontract. </p>

The subcontractor retains all rights provided for the contractor in the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-11. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Inclusion of patent rights clause—subcontractors other than non-profit organizations and small business firms.</i> Except for the subcontracts described in subparagraph (g)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-13, suitably modified to identify the parties, in any contract for experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work. For subcontracts subject to exceptional circumstances, the contractor must consult with DOE patent counsel with respect to the appropriate patent clause. </p>

<p>(4) <i>DOE and subcontractor contract.</i> With respect to subcontracts at any tier, DOE, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause. </p>

<p>(5) <i>Subcontractor refusal to accept terms of patent clause.</i> If a prospective subcontractor refuses to accept the terms of a patent rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer stating the subcontractor's reasons for such a refusal, including any relevant information for expediting disposition of the matter, and the Contractor shall not proceed with the subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer. </p>

<p>(6) <i>Notification of award of subcontract.</i> Upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing and identify the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of a subcontract. </p>

<p>(7) <i>Identification of subcontractor subject inventions.</i> If the Contractor in the performance of this contract becomes aware of a subject invention made under a subcontract, the Contractor shall promptly notify Patent Counsel and identify the subject invention. </p>

<p>(h) <i>Reporting on utilization of subject inventions.</i> The Contractor agrees to submit to DOE on request, periodic reports, no more frequently than annually, on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by DOE in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor. </p>

<p>(i) <i>Preference for United States Industry.</i> Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. </p>

<p>(j) <i>March-in Rights.</i> The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any DOE supplemental regulations to require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and, if the Contractor, assignee or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself if DOE determines that—</p>

<p>(1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use; </p>

<p>(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their licensees; </p>

<p>(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or </p>

<p>(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this clause has not been obtained or waived, or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement. </p>

<p>(k) <i>Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations.</i> If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that—</p>

<p>(1) <i>DOE approval of assignment of rights.</i> Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned by the Contractor without the approval of DOE, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions; provided, that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions of this clause as the Contractor. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Small business firm licensees.</i> It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms, and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Contractor. However, the Contractor agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business firm applicants, and the Contractor will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when that Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of this subparagraph (k)(2). </p>

<p>(3) <i>Contractor licensing of subject inventions.</i> To the extent that it provides the most effective technology transfer, licensing of subject inventions shall be administered by Contractor employees on location at the facility. </p>

<p>(l) <i>Communications.</i> The Contractor shall direct any notification, disclosure or request provided for in this clause to the Patent Counsel assisting the DOE contracting activity. </p>

<p>(m) <i>Reports</i>—(1) <i>Interim reports.</i> Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit to DOE, no more frequently than annually, a list of subject inventions disclosed to DOE during a specified period, or a statement that no subject inventions were made during the specified period; and a list of subcontracts containing a patent clause and awarded by the Contractor during a specified period, or a statement that no such subcontracts were awarded during the specified period. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Final reports.</i> Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit to DOE, prior to closeout of the contract, a list of all subject inventions disclosed during the performance period of the contract, or a statement that no subject inventions were made during the contract performance period; and a list of all subcontracts containing a patent clause and awarded by the Contractor during the contract performance period, or a statement that no such subcontracts were awarded during the contract performance period. </p>

<p>(n) <i>Examination of Records Relating to Subject Inventions</i>—(1) <i>Contractor compliance.</i> Until the expiration of three (3) years after final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer or any authorized representative may examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, documents, and other supporting data of the Contractor, which the Contracting Officer or authorized representative deems reasonably pertinent to the discovery or identification of subject inventions, including exceptional circumstance subject inventions, or to determine Contractor compliance with any requirement of this clause. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Unreported inventions.</i> If the Contracting Officer is aware of an invention that is not disclosed by the Contractor to DOE, and the Contracting Officer believes the unreported invention may be a subject invention, including exceptional circumstance subject inventions, DOE may require the Contractor to submit to DOE a disclosure of the invention for a determination of ownership rights. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Confidentiality.</i> Any examination of records under this paragraph is subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved. </p>

<p>(4) <i>Power of inspection.</i> With respect to a subject invention for which the Contractor has responsibility for patent prosecution, the Contractor shall furnish the Government, upon request by DOE, an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of a prosecution file for any patent application claiming the subject invention. </p>

<p>(o) <i>Facilities License.</i> In addition to the rights of the parties with respect to inventions or discoveries conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, the Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license in and to any inventions or discoveries regardless of when conceived or actually reduced to practice or acquired by the Contractor at any time through completion of this contract and which are incorporated or embodied in the construction of the facility or which are utilized in the operation of the facility or which cover articles, materials, or product manufactured at the facility (1) to practice or have practiced by or for the Government at the facility, and (2) to transfer such license with the transfer of that facility.

<p>(1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use; </p>

<p>(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs that are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their licensees; </p>

<p>(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by government regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or</p>

<p>(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement to substantially manufacture in the United States and required by paragraph (i) of this clause has neither been obtained nor waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement. </p>

<p>(k) <i>Communications.</i> The Contractor shall direct any notification, disclosure, or request provided for in this clause to the Patent Counsel identified in the contract.</p>

The interim report shall state whether the Contractor's invention disclosures were submitted to DOE in accordance with the requirements of subparagraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4) of this clause. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Final reports.</i> Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit to DOE, prior to closeout of the contract or within three (3) months of the date of completion of the contracted work, a list of all subject inventions disclosed during the performance period of the contract, or a statement that no subject inventions were made during the contract performance period; and/or a list of all subcontracts containing a patent clause and awarded by the Contractor during the contract performance period, or a statement that no such subcontracts were awarded during the contract performance period. </p>

<p>(m) <i>Facilities License.</i> In addition to the rights of the parties with respect to inventions or discoveries conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, the Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license in and to any inventions or discoveries regardless of when conceived or actually reduced to practice or acquired by the contractor at any time through completion of this contract and which are incorporated or embodied in the construction of the facility or which are utilized in the operation of the facility or which cover articles, materials, or products manufactured at the facility (1) to practice or have practiced by or for the Government at the facility, and (2) to transfer such license with the transfer of that facility. Notwithstanding the acceptance or exercise by the Government of these rights, the Government may contest at any time the enforceability, validity or scope of, or title to, any rights or patents herein licensed.</p>

<p>(n) <i>Atomic energy</i>—(1) <i>Pecuniary awards.</i> No claim for pecuniary award of compensation under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, may be asserted with respect to any invention or discovery made or conceived in the course of or under this contract. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Patent agreements.</i> Except as otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall obtain patent agreements to effectuate the provisions of subparagraph (o)(1) of this clause from all persons who perform any part of the work under this contract, except nontechnical personnel, such as clerical employees and manual laborers. </p>

<p>(o) <i>Classified inventions</i>—(1) <i>Approval for filing a foreign patent application.</i> The Contractor shall not file or cause to be filed an application or registration for a patent disclosing a subject invention related to classified subject matter in any country other than the United States without first obtaining the written approval of the Contracting Officer. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Inclusion of clause in subcontracts.</i> The Contractor agrees to include the substance of this clause in subcontracts at any tier that cover or are likely to cover subject matter classified for reasons of security. </p>

<p>(p) <i>Examination of records relating to inventions</i>—(1) <i>Contractor compliance.</i> Until the expiration of three (3) years after final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer or any authorized representative may examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents and other supporting data of the Contractor, which the Contracting Officer or authorized representative deems reasonably pertinent to the discovery or identification of subject inventions, including exceptional circumstance subject inventions, or to determine Contractor (and inventor) compliance with the requirements of this clause, including proper identification and disclosure of subject inventions, and establishment and maintenance of invention disclosure procedures. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Unreported inventions.</i> If the Contracting Officer is aware of an invention that is not disclosed by the Contractor to DOE, and the Contracting Officer believes the unreported invention may be a subject invention, DOE may require the Contractor to submit to DOE a disclosure of the invention for a determination of ownership rights. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Confidentiality.</i> Any examination of records under this paragraph is subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved. </p>

Any State or local tax, fee, or charge paid with the approval of the Contracting Officer or on the basis of advice from the Contracting Officer that such tax, fee, or charge is applicable and valid, and which would otherwise be an allowable item of cost, shall not be disallowed as an item of cost by reason of any subsequent ruling or determination that such tax, fee, or charge was in fact inapplicable or invalid. </p>

<p>(b) The Contractor agrees to take such action as may be required or approved by the Contracting Officer to cause any State or local tax, fee, or charge which would be an allowable cost to be paid under protest; and to take such action as may be required or approved by the Contracting Officer to seek recovery of any payments made, including assignment to the Government or its designee of all rights to an abatement or refund thereof, and granting permission for the Government to join with the Contractor in any proceedings for the recovery thereof or to sue for recovery in the name of the Contractor. If the Contracting Officer directs the Contractor to institute litigation to enjoin the collection of or to recover payment of any such tax, fee, or charge referred to above, or if a claim or suit is filed against the Contractor for a tax, fee, or charge it has refrained from paying in accordance with this clause, the procedures and requirements of the clause entitled “Insurance—Litigation and Claims” shall apply and the costs and expenses incurred by the Contractor shall be allowable items of costs, as provided in this contract, together with the amount of any judgment rendered against the Contractor. </p>

<p>(c) The Government shall hold the Contractor harmless from penalties and interest incurred through compliance with this clause. All recoveries or credits in respect of the foregoing taxes, fees, and charges (including interest) shall inure to and be for the sole benefit of the Government.</p>

<p>As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1), insert the following clause:</p>

<p><b>Payments and Advances (DEC 2000)</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Installments of fixed-fee.</i> The fixed-fee payable under this contract shall become due and payable in periodic installments in accordance with a schedule determined by the Contracting Officer. Fixed-fee payments shall be made by direct payment or withdrawn from funds advanced or available under this contract, as determined by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may offset against any such fee payment the amounts owed to the Government by the Contractor, including any amounts owed for disallowed costs under this contract. No fixed-fee payment may be withdrawn against the payments cleared financing arrangement without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. </p>

<p>(b) <i>Payments on Account of Allowable Costs.</i> The Contracting Officer and the Contractor shall agree as to the extent to which payment for allowable costs or payments for other items specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer (for example, negotiated fixed amounts) shall be made from advances of Government funds. When pension contributions are paid by the Contractor to the retirement fund less frequently than quarterly, accrued costs therefore shall be excluded from costs for payment purposes until such costs are paid. If pension contribution are paid on a quarterly or more frequent basis, accrual therefore may be included in costs for payment purposes, provided that they are paid to the fund within 30 days after the close of the period covered. If payments are not made to the fund within such 30-day period, pension contribution costs shall be excluded from cost for payment purposes until payment has been made. </p>

<p>(c) <i>Special financial institution account—use.</i> All advances of Government funds shall be withdrawn pursuant to a payments cleared financing arrangement prescribed by DOE in favor of the financial institution or, at the option of the Government, shall be made by direct payment or other payment mechanism to the Contractor, and shall be deposited only in the special financial institution account referred to in the Special Financial Institution Account Agreement, which is incorporated into this contract as Appendix—. No part of the funds in the special financial institution account shall be commingled with any funds of the Contractor or used for a purpose other than that of making payments for costs allowable and, if applicable, fees earned under this contract, negotiated fixed amounts, or payments for other items specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer determines that the balance of such special financial institution account exceeds the Contractor's current needs, the Contractor shall promptly make such disposition of the excess as the Contracting Officer may direct.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Title to funds advanced.</i> Title to the unexpended balance of any funds advanced and of any special financial institution account established pursuant to this clause shall remain in the Government and be superior to any claim or lien of the financial institution of deposit or others. It is understood that an advance to the Contractor hereunder is not a loan to the Contractor, and will not require the payment of interest by the Contractor, and that the Contractor acquires no right, title or interest in or to such advance other than the right to make expenditures therefrom, as provided in this clause. </p>

<p>(e) <i>Financial settlement.</i> The Government shall promptly pay to the Contractor the unpaid balance of allowable costs (or other items specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer) and fee upon termination of the work, expiration of the term of the contract, or completion of the work and its acceptance by the Government after— </p>

<p>(1) Compliance by the Contractor with DOE's patent clearance requirements; and </p>

<p>(2) The furnishing by the Contractor of—</p>

<p>(i) An assignment of the Contractor's rights to any refunds, rebates, allowances, accounts receivable, collections accruing to the Contractor in connection with the work under this contract, or other credits applicable to allowable costs under the contract; </p>

<p>(ii) A closing financial statement; </p>

<p>(iii) The accounting for Government-owned property required by the clause entitled “Property”; and </p>

<p>(iv) A release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract subject only to the following exceptions— </p>

<p>(A) Specified claims in stated amounts or in estimated amounts where the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor; </p>

<p>(B) Claims, together with reasonable expenses incidental thereto, based upon liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of the performance of this contract; provided that such claims are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release; and provided further that the Contractor gives notice of such claims in writing to the Contracting Officer promptly, but not more than one (1) year after the Contractor's right of action first accrues. In addition, the Contractor shall provide prompt notice to the Contracting Officer of all potential claims under this clause, whether in litigation or not (see Contract Clause, 48 CFR 970.5228-1, Insurance—Litigation and Claims);</p>

<p>(C) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of any indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable expenses incidental thereto, incurred by the Contractor under the provisions of this contract relating to patents; and </p>

<p>(D) Claims recognizable under the clause entitled, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement. </p>

<p>(3) In arriving at the amount due the Contractor under this clause, there shall be deducted— </p>

<p>(i) Any claim which the Government may have against the Contractor in connection with this contract; and </p>

<p>(ii) Deductions due under the terms of this contract and not otherwise recovered by or credited to the Government. The unliquidated balance of the special financial institution account may be applied to the amount due and any balance shall be returned to the Government forthwith.</p>

<p>(f) <i>Claims.</i> Claims for credit against funds advanced for payment shall be accompanied by such supporting documents and justification as the Contracting Officer shall prescribe. </p>

<p>(g) <i>Discounts.</i> The Contractor shall take and afford the Government the advantage of all known and available cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, and commissions unless the Contracting Officer finds that action is not in the best interest of the Government. </p>

<p>(h) <i>Collections.</i> All collections accruing to the Contractor in connection with the work under this contract, except for the Contractor's fee and royalties or other income accruing to the Contractor from technology transfer activities in accordance with this contract, shall be Government property and shall be processed and accounted for in accordance with applicable requirements imposed by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Laws, regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract and, to the extent consistent with those requirements, shall be deposited in the special financial institution account or otherwise made available for payment of allowable costs under this contract, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer. </p>

<p>(i) <i>Direct payment of charges.</i> The Government reserves the right, upon ten days written notice from the Contracting Officer to the Contractor, to pay directly to the persons concerned, all amounts due which otherwise would be allowable under this contract. Any payment so made shall discharge the Government of all liability to the Contractor therefore.</p>

<p>(j) <i>Determining allowable costs.</i> The Contracting Officer shall determine allowable costs in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 31.2 and the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation subpart 48 CFR 970.31 in effect on the date of this contract and other provisions of this contract.</p>

<p><b>(End of clause)</b></p>

<p><i>Alterate I</i> (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1)(i), if a separate fixed-fee is provided for a separate item of work, paragraph (a) of the basic clause should be modified to permit payment of the entire fixed-fee upon completion of that item.</p>

Total available fee amount earned is payable following the Government's Determination of Total Available Fee Amount Earned in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled “Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount.” Base fee amount and total available fee amount earned payments shall be made by direct payment or withdrawn from funds advanced or available under this contract, as determined by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may offset against any such fee payment the amounts owed to the Government by the Contractor, including any amounts owed for disallowed costs under this contract. No base fee amount or total available fee amount earned payment may be withdrawn against the payments cleared financing arrangement without the prior written approval of the contracting officer.</p>

<p><i>Alternate III</i> (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1)(iii), the following paragraph (k) shall be included in management and operating contracts with integrated accounting systems:</p>

<p>(k) Review and approval of costs incurred. The Contractor shall prepare and submit annually as of September 30, a “Statement of Costs Incurred and Claimed” (Cost Statement) for the total of net expenditures accrued (i.e., net costs incurred) for the period covered by the Cost Statement. The Contractor shall certify the Cost Statement subject to the penalty provisions for unallowable costs as stated in sections 306(b) and (i) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 256), as amended. DOE, after audit and appropriate adjustment, will approve such Cost Statement. This approval by DOE will constitute an acknowledgment by DOE that the net costs incurred are allowable under the contract and that they have been recorded in the accounts maintained by the Contractor in accordance with DOE accounting policies, but will not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for DOE's assets in its care, for appropriate subsequent adjustments, or for errors later becoming known to DOE.</p>

<p><i>Alternate IV</i> (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1)(iv), the following paragraph (k) shall be included in management and operating contracts without integrated accounting systems:</p>

<p>(k) <i>Certification and penalties.</i> The Contractor shall prepare and submit a “Statement of Costs Incurred and Claimed” (Cost Statement) for the total of net expenditures incurred for the period covered by the Cost Statement. It is anticipated that this will be an annual submission unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall certify the Cost Statement subject to the penalty provisions for unallowable costs as stated in sections 306(b) and (i) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 256), as amended.</p>

In addition, the Contracting Officer, where he or she deems it appropriate, may: Impose a penalty under 48 CFR 970.5242-1, Penalties for Unallowable Costs; require a refund; reduce the contractor's otherwise earned fee; and take such other action as authorized in law, regulation, or this contract.</p>

Such collections, to the extent actually received by the Contractor, shall be processed and accounted for in accordance with applicable requirements imposed by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Laws, regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract. Nothing in this paragraph is to be construed as authorizing the Contractor to exceed limitations stated in financial plans established by DOE and furnished to the Contractor from time to time under this contract. </p>

<p>(b) <i>Limitation on payment by the Government.</i> Except as otherwise provided in this contract and except for costs which may be incurred by the Contractor pursuant to the Termination clause of this contract or costs of claims allowable under the contract occurring after completion or termination and not released by the Contractor at the time of financial settlement of the contract in accordance with the clause entitled “Payments and Advances,” payment by the Government under this contract on account of allowable costs shall not, in the aggregate, exceed the amount obligated with respect to this contract, less the Contractor's fee and any negotiated fixed amount.

Whenever the unexpended balance of available funds (including collections available under paragraph (a) of this clause), less the amount of the Contractor's fee then earned but not paid and any negotiated fixed amounts, is in the Contractor's best judgment sufficient only to liquidate outstanding encumbrances and liabilities on account of costs allowable under this contract, the Contractor shall immediately notify DOE and shall make no further encumbrances or expenditures (except to liquidate existing encumbrances and liabilities), and, unless the parties otherwise agree, the Contractor shall be excused from further performance (except such performance as may become necessary in connection with termination by the Government) and the performance of all work hereunder will be deemed to have been terminated for the convenience of the Government in accordance with the provisions of the Termination clause of this contract. </p>

Such plans and directives may be amended or supplemented from time to time by DOE. The Contractor agrees— </p>

<p>(b) If, during the review of a submission for settlement of cost incurred, the Contracting Officer determines that the submission contains an expressly unallowable cost or a cost determined to be unallowable prior to the submission, the Contracting Officer shall assess a penalty.</p>

<p>(c) Unallowable costs are either expressly unallowable or determined unallowable.</p>

<p>(1) An expressly unallowable cost is a particular item or type of cost which, under the express provisions of an applicable law, regulation, or this contract, is specifically named and stated to be unallowable.</p>

<p>(1) Expressly unallowable, then the Contracting Officer shall assess a penalty in an amount equal to the disallowed cost allocated to this contract plus interest on the paid portion of the disallowed cost. Interest shall be computed from the date of overpayment to the date of repayment using the interest rate specified by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Pub. L. 92-41 (85 Stat. 97); or</p>

Any claim by the Contractor for an adjustment under this clause must be asserted in writing within 30 days from the date of receipt by the Contractor of the notification of change; provided, however, that the Contracting Officer, if it is determined that the facts justify such action, may receive and act upon any such claim asserted at any time prior to final payment under this contract. A failure to agree on an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be deemed to be a dispute within the meaning of the clause entitled “Disputes.” </p>

<p>As prescribed in 970.4403 insert the following clause:</p>

<p><b>Contractor Purchasing System (AUG 2016)</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>General.</i> The Contractor shall develop, implement, and maintain formal policies, practices, and procedures to be used in the award of subcontracts consistent with this clause and 48 CFR subpart 970.44. The Contractor's purchasing system and methods shall be fully documented, consistently applied, and acceptable to the Department of Energy (DOE) in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4401-1. The Contractor shall maintain file documentation which is appropriate to the value of the purchase and is adequate to establish the propriety of the transaction and the price paid. The Contractor's purchasing performance will be evaluated against such performance criteria and measures as may be set forth elsewhere in this contract. DOE reserves the right at any time to require that the Contractor submit for approval any or all purchases under this contract. The Contractor shall not purchase any item or service, the purchase of which is expressly prohibited by the written direction of DOE, and shall use such special and directed sources as may be expressly required by the DOE Contracting Officer. DOE will conduct periodic appraisals of the Contractor's management of all facets of the purchasing function, including the Contractor's compliance with its approved system and methods. Such appraisals will be performed through the conduct of Contractor Purchasing System Reviews in accordance with 48 CFR subpart 44.3, or, when approved by the Contracting Officer, through the Contractor's participation in the conduct of the Balanced Scorecard performance measurement and performance management system. The Contractor's approved purchasing system and methods shall include the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (y) of this clause.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Acquisition of utility services.</i> Utility services shall be acquired in accordance with the requirements of 48 CFR subpart 970.41.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Acquisition of real property.</i> Real property shall be acquired in accordance with 48 CFR subpart 917.74.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Advance notice of proposed subcontract awards.</i> Advance notice shall be provided in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4401-3.</p>

<p>(e) <i>Audit of subcontractors.</i> (1) The Contractor shall provide for—</p>

<p>(i) Periodic post-award audit of cost-reimbursement subcontractors at all tiers; and</p>

<p>(ii) Audits, where necessary, to provide a valid basis for pre-award or cost or price analysis.</p>

<p>(2) Responsibility for determining the costs allowable under each cost-reimbursement subcontract remains with the contractor or next higher-tier subcontractor. The Contractor shall provide, in appropriate cases, for the timely involvement of the Contractor and the DOE Contracting Officer in resolution of subcontract cost allowability.</p>

<p>(3) Where audits of subcontractors at any tier are required, arrangements may be made to have the cognizant Federal agency perform the audit of the subcontract. These arrangements shall be made administratively between DOE and the other agency involved and shall provide for the cognizant agency to audit in an appropriate manner in light of the magnitude and nature of the subcontract. In no case, however, shall these arrangements preclude determination by the DOE Contracting Officer of the allowability or unallowability of subcontractor costs claimed for reimbursement by the Contractor.</p>

<p>(4) Allowable costs for cost reimbursable subcontracts are to be determined in accordance with the cost principles of 48 CFR Part 31, appropriate for the type of organization to which the subcontract is to be awarded, as supplemented by 48 CFR part 931. Allowable costs in the purchase or transfer from contractor-affiliated sources shall be determined in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4402-3 and 48 CFR 31.205-26(e).</p>

<p>(f) <i>Bonds and insurance.</i> (1) The Contractor shall require performance bonds in penal amounts as set forth in 48 CFR 28.102-2(a) for all fixed-priced and unit-priced construction subcontracts in excess of $150,000. The Contractor shall consider the use of performance bonds in fixed-price non-construction subcontracts, where appropriate.</p>

<p>(2) For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost reimbursement construction subcontracts in excess of $150,000, a payment bond shall be obtained on Standard Form 25A modified to name the Contractor as well as the United States of America as obligees. The penal amounts shall be determined in accordance with 48 CFR 28.102-2(b).</p>

<p>(3) For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost-reimbursement construction subcontracts greater than $25,000, but not greater than $100,000, the Contractor shall select two or more of the payment protections at 48 CFR 28.102-1(b), giving particular consideration to the inclusion of an irrevocable letter of credit as one of the selected alternatives.</p>

<p>(4) A subcontractor may have more than one acceptable surety in both construction and other subcontracts, provided that in no case will the liability of any one surety exceed the maximum penal sum for which it is qualified for any one obligation. For subcontracts other than construction, a co-surety (two or more sureties together) may reinsure amounts in excess of their individual capacity, with each surety having the required underwriting capacity that appears on the list of acceptable corporate sureties.</p>

<p>(g) <i>Buy American.</i> The Contractor shall comply with the provisions of the Buy American Act as reflected in 48 CFR 52.225-1 and 48 CFR 52.225-9. The Contractor shall forward determinations of non-availability of individual items to the DOE Contracting Officer for approval. Items in excess of $500,000 require the prior concurrence of the Head of Contracting Activity. If, however, the Contractor has an approved purchasing system, the Head of the Contracting Activity may authorize the Contractor to make determinations of non-availability for individual items valued at $500,000 or less.</p>

<p>(h) <i>Construction and architect-engineer subcontracts.</i> (1) <i>Independent Estimates.</i> A detailed, independent estimate of costs shall be prepared for all construction work to be subcontracted.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Specifications.</i> Specifications for construction shall be prepared in accordance with the DOE publication entitled “General Design Criteria Manual.”</p>

<p>(3) <i>Prevention of conflict of interest.</i> (i) The Contractor shall not award a subcontract for construction to the architect-engineer firm or an affiliate that prepared the design. This prohibition does not preclude the award of a “turnkey” subcontract so long as the subcontractor assumes all liability for defects in design and construction and consequential damages.</p>

<p>(ii) The Contractor shall not award both a cost-reimbursement subcontract and a fixed-price subcontract for construction or architect-engineer services or any combination thereof to the same firm where those subcontracts will be performed at the same site.</p>

<p>(iii) The Contractor shall not employ the construction subcontractor or an affiliate to inspect the firm's work. The contractor shall assure that the working relationships of the construction subcontractor and the subcontractor inspecting its work and the authority of the inspector are clearly defined.</p>

<p>(i) <i>Contractor-affiliated sources.</i> Equipment, materials, supplies, or services from a contractor-affiliated source shall be purchased or transferred in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4402-3.</p>

<p>(j) <i>Contractor-subcontractor relationship.</i> The obligations of the Contractor under paragraph (a) of this clause, including the development of the purchasing system and methods, and purchases made pursuant thereto, shall not relieve the Contractor of any obligation under this contract (including, among other things, the obligation to properly supervise, administer, and coordinate the work of subcontractors). Subcontracts shall be in the name of the Contractor, and shall not bind or purport to bind the Government.</p>

<p>(k) <i>Government Property.</i> The Contractor shall establish and maintain a property management system that complies with criteria in 48 CFR 970.5245-1, Property, and 48 CFR 52.245-1, Government Property.</p>

<p>(l) <i>Indemnification.</i> Except for Price-Anderson Nuclear Hazards Indemnity, no subcontractor may be indemnified except with the prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive.</p>

<p>(m) <i>Leasing of motor vehicles.</i> Contractors shall comply with 48 CFR subpart 8.11 and 48 CFR subpart 908.11.</p>

<p>(q) <i>Purchase of special items.</i> Purchase of the following items shall be in accordance with the following provisions of 48 CFR subpart 8.5, 48 CFR subpart 908.71, Federal Management Regulation 41 CFR part 102, and the Federal Property Management Regulation 41 CFR chapter 101:</p>

<p>(1) At time of original acquisition;</p>

<p>(2) When lease renewals are being considered; and</p>

<p>(3) At other times as circumstances warrant.</p>

<p>(s) <i>Quality assurance.</i> Contractors shall provide no less protection for the Government in its subcontracts than is provided in the prime contract.</p>

<p>(u) <i>Strategic and critical materials.</i> The Contractor may use strategic and critical materials in the National Defense Stockpile.</p>

<p>(v) <i>Termination.</i> When subcontracts are terminated as a result of the termination of all or a portion of this contract, the Contractor shall settle with subcontractors in conformity with the policies and principles relating to settlement of prime contracts in 48 CFR subparts 49.1, 49.2 and 49.3. When subcontracts are terminated for reasons other than termination of this contract, the Contractor shall settle such subcontracts in general conformity with the policies and principles in 48 CFR subparts 49.1, 49.2, 49.3 and 49.4. Each such termination shall be documented and consistent with the terms of this contract.

The Government reserves the right to inspect, and to accept or reject, any item of such property. The Contractor shall make such disposition of rejected items as the Contracting Officer shall direct. Title to other property, the cost of which is reimbursable to the Contractor under this contract, shall pass to and vest in the Government upon (1) issuance for use of such property in the performance of this contract, or (2) commencement of processing or use of such property in the performance of this contract, or (3) reimbursement of the cost thereof by the Government, whichever first occurs. Property furnished by the Government and property purchased or furnished by the Contractor, title to which vests in the Government, under this paragraph are hereinafter referred to as Government property. Title to Government property shall not be affected by the incorporation of the property into or the attachment of it to any property not owned by the Government, nor shall such Government property or any part thereof, be or become a fixture or lose its identity as personality by reason of affixation to any realty. </p>

<p>(c) <i>Identification.</i> To the extent directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall identify Government property coming into the Contractor's possession or custody, by marking and segregating in such a way, satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, as shall indicate its ownership by the Government. </p>

<p>(d) <i>Disposition.</i> The Contractor shall make such disposition of Government property which has come into the possession or custody of the Contractor under this contract as the Contracting Officer may direct during the progress of the work or upon completion or termination of this contract. The Contractor may, upon such terms and conditions as the Contracting Officer may approve, sell, or exchange such property, or acquire such property at a price agreed upon by the Contracting Officer and the Contractor as the fair value thereof. The amount received by the Contractor as the result of any disposition, or the agreed fair value of any such property acquired by the Contractor, shall be applied in reduction of costs allowable under this contract or shall be otherwise credited to account to the Government, as the Contracting Officer may direct. Upon completion of the work or the termination of this contract, the Contractor shall render an accounting, as prescribed by the Contracting Officer, of all government property which had come into the possession or custody of the Contractor under this contract. </p>

<p>(e) <i>Protection of government property—management of high-risk property and classified materials.</i> (1) The Contractor shall take all reasonable precautions, and such other actions as may be directed by the Contracting Officer, or in the absence of such direction, in accordance with sound business practice, to safeguard and protect government property in the Contractor's possession or custody. </p>

<p>(2) In addition, the Contractor shall ensure that adequate safeguards are in place, and adhered to, for the handling, control and disposition of high-risk property and classified materials throughout the life cycle of the property and materials consistent with the policies, practices and procedures for property management contained in the Federal Property Management Regulations (41 CFR chapter 101), the Department of Energy (DOE) Property Management Regulations (41 CFR chapter 109), and other applicable Regulations. </p>

High-risk property includes proliferation sensitive, nuclear related dual use, export controlled, chemically or radioactively contaminated, hazardous, and specially designed and prepared property, including property on the militarily critical technologies list. </p>

<p>(A) Willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; </p>

<p>(B) Failure of the Contractor's managerial personnel to take all reasonable steps to comply with any appropriate written direction of the Contracting Officer to safeguard such property under paragraph (e) of this clause; or</p>

<p>(C) Failure of contractor managerial personnel to establish, administer, or properly maintain an approved property management system in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this clause. </p>

<p>(ii) If, after an initial review of the facts, the Contracting Officer informs the Contractor that there is reason to believe that the loss, destruction of, or damage to the government property results from conduct falling within one of the categories set forth above, the burden of proof shall be upon the Contractor to show that the Contractor should not be required to compensate the government for the loss, destruction, or damage. </p>

<p>(2) In the event that the Contractor is determined liable for the loss, destruction or damage to Government property in accordance with (f)(1) of this clause, the Contractor's compensation to the Government shall be determined as follows: </p>

<p>(i) For damaged property, the compensation shall be the cost of repairing such damaged property, plus any costs incurred for temporary replacement of the damaged property. However, the value of repair costs shall not exceed the fair market value of the damaged property. If a fair market value of the property does not exist, the Contracting Officer shall determine the value of such property, consistent with all relevant facts and circumstances. </p>

<p>(ii) For destroyed or lost property, the compensation shall be the fair market value of such property at the time of such loss or destruction, plus any costs incurred for temporary replacement and costs associated with the disposition of destroyed property. If a fair market value of the property does not exist, the Contracting Officer shall determine the value of such property, consistent with all relevant facts and circumstances. </p>
