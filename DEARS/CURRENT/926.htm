<p>(5) Any competitively awarded subcontract to one of the three target groups under a prime award.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Prime contract awards</i>. Award values and dollars obligated under prime contracts and modifications to prime contracts for Energy Policy Act requirements shall be reported through the Department of Energy Procurement and Assistance Data System.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Subcontract awards</i>.
