</p>
                                    <p xtrc="P">The Department of Energy has established a Mentor-Protege Program to encourage its prime contractors to assist firms certified under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act by SBA, other small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions, other minority institutions of higher learning and small business concerns owned and controlled by service disabled veterans in enhancing their business abilities. If the contract resulting from this solicitation is awarded on a cost-plus-award fee basis, the Contractor's performance as a Mentor may be evaluated as part of the award fee plan. Mentor and Protege firms will develop and submit “lessons learned” evaluations to DOE at the conclusion of the contract. Any DOE contractor that is interested in becoming a Mentor should refer to the applicable regulations at 48 CFR 919.70 and should contact the Department of Energy's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.</p>
