                                    <p xtrc="HD1">Agency Protest Review (SEP 1996)
</p>
                                    <p xtrc="P">Protests to the Agency will be decided either at the level of the Head of the Contracting Activity or at the Headquarters level. The Department of Energy's agency protest procedures, set forth in 48 CFR 933.103, elaborate on these options and on the availability of a suspension of a procurement that is protested to the agency. The Department encourages potential protesters to discuss their concerns with the Contracting Officer prior to filing a protest.</p>
