In order that public disclosure of such information will not adversely affect the patent interest of DOE or the Contractor, approval for release or publication shall be secured from the Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters prior to any such release or publication. Where DOE's approval of publication is requested, DOE's response to such requests for approval shall normally be provided within 90 days except in circumstances in which a domestic patent application must be filed in order to protect foreign rights. In the case involving foreign patent rights, DOE shall be granted an additional 180 days with which to respond to the request for approval, unless extended by mutual agreement.

</p>
                                    <p outputclass="List2">(4) If the Contractor requests that DOE acquire title or rights from the Contractor in a subject invention to which the Contractor had initially retained title or rights, or in an exceptional circumstance subject invention to which the Contractor was granted greater rights, DOE may acquire such title or rights from the Contractor, or DOE may decide against acquiring such title or rights from the Contractor, at DOE's sole discretion.

			<i>Request for a Contractor license.</i> The Contractor may request the right to reserve a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the Contractor fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. DOE may grant or refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor. When DOE approves such reservation, the Contractor's license will normally extend to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.

This license will not be revoked in the field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the subject invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application of the subject invention in that foreign country. 
</p>
                                    <p outputclass="List2">(3) <i>Notice of revocation of modification of a Contractor license.</i> Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781 concerning the licensing of Government owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.

This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
