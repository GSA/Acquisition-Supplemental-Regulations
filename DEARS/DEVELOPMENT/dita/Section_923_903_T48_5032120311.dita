         <p xtrc="P">The FAR Environmental Management Systems clause at 52.223-XX should be used in contracts where the contractor operates a DOE site or portion thereof. Some DOE sites have a single Environmental Management System for the site while others have separate Environmental Management Systems for various portions of the site which may be operated by different contractors. Check with local environmental management personnel regarding the applicability of the FAR 52.223-XX clause to a specific contract.
