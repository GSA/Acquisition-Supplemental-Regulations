      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) Contracting officers must use the clause at 970.5227-6, Patent Indemnity - Subcontracts to assure that subcontracts appropriately address patent indemnity. 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) Normally, the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-3 would not be appropriate for an M&amp;O contract; however, if there is a question, such as when the mission of the contractor involves production, the contracting officer must consult with local patent counsel and use the clause where appropriate.
