<p>(a)&nbsp; The Contractor shall be responsible for Information Technology security for all systems connected to a Department of Transportation (DOT) network or operated by the Contractor for DOT, regardless of location. This clause is applicable to all or any part of the contract that includes information technology resources or services in which the Contractor has physical or electronic access to DOT’s sensitive information that directly supports the mission of DOT.

<p>(c) Within 30 days after contract award, the contractor shall submit the IT Security Plan to the DOT Contracting Officer for acceptance.&nbsp; This plan shall be consistent with and further detail the approach contained in the <font size="+0">offeror's</font> proposal or sealed bid that resulted in the award of this contract and in compliance with the requirements stated in this clause.&nbsp; The plan, as accepted by the Contracting Officer, shall be incorporated into the contract as a compliance document.&nbsp; The Contractor shall comply with the accepted plan.</p>

<p>(d) Within 6 months after contract award, the contractor shall submit written proof of IT Security accreditation to the DOT for acceptance by the DOT Contracting Officer.&nbsp; Such written proof may be furnished either by the Contractor or by a third party.&nbsp; Accreditation must be in accordance with DOT Order 1350.2, which is available from the Contracting Officer upon request.&nbsp; This accreditation will include a final security plan, risk assessment, security test and evaluation, and disaster recovery plan/continuity of operations plan.

<p>Unauthorized access is a violation of U.S. Law and Department of Transportation policy, and may result in criminal or administrative penalties. Users shall not access other user's or system files without proper authority. Absence of access controls IS NOT authorization for access! DOT information systems and related equipment are intended for communication, transmission, processing and storage of U.S. Government information. These systems and equipment are subject to monitoring by law enforcement and authorized Department officials. Monitoring may result in the acquisition, recording, and analysis of all data being communicated, transmitted, processed or stored in this system by law enforcement and authorized Department officials.&nbsp; Use of this system constitutes consent to such monitoring.</p>

<p align="center"><b>**WARNING**WARNING**WARNING**</b></p>

<p>(g) The contractor will ensure that the following banner is displayed on all DOT systems that contain Privacy Act information operated by the contractor prior to allowing anyone access to the system:</p>

<p>This system contains information protected under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-579). Any privacy information displayed on the screen or printed shall be protected from unauthorized disclosure. Employees who violate privacy safeguards may be subject to disciplinary actions, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.</p>

<p>(h) Contractor personnel requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to systems operated by the Contractor for DOT or interconnected to a DOT network shall be screened at an appropriate level in accordance with DOT Order 1630.2B, Personnel Security Management, as it may be amended from time to time during the term of this contract.</p>

<p>(i) The Contractor shall ensure that its employees, in performance of the contract performing under this contract, receive annual IT security training in accordance with OMB Circular A-130, FISMA, and NIST requirements, as they may be amended from time to time during the term of this contract, with a specific emphasis on rules of behavior.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(j) The Contractor shall afford the Government access to the Contractor’s and subcontractors’ facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases and personnel used in performance of the contract. Access shall be provided to the extent required to carry out a program of IT inspection (to include vulnerability testing), investigation and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of DOT data or to the function of information technology systems operated on behalf of DOT, and to preserve evidence of computer crime.</p>

<p>(k) The Contractor shall incorporate the substance of this clause in all subcontracts that meet the conditions in paragraph (a) of this clause.</p>
