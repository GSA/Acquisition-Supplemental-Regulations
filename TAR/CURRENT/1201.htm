<p><a name="P2_96"></a><b>1201.101 Purpose.</b></p>

<p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) Acquisition Regulation (TAR) establishes uniform acquisition policies and procedures, which implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).</p>

<p>(a) Statute, the (FAR) Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) chapter 1, and (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 apply to all acquisitions within the Department unless otherwise excluded by statute, the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1, or (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12.</p>

<p>(b) The following order of precedence applies to resolve any question of applicability concerning an acquisition regulation or a procedure found within (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 or the Transportation Acquisition Manual (TAM):</p>

<p>(1) Statute;</p>

<p>(2) (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 or other applicable regulation;</p>

<p>(3) (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12;</p>

<p>(4) DOT Orders; and</p>

<p>(5) TAM.</p>

<p>(c) The Maritime Administration may depart from the requirements of the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 and (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 as authorized by 40 U.S.C. 113(e)(15) but shall adhere to those regulations to the maximum extent practicable.&nbsp; Exceptions from the requirements of the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 and/or (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 shall be documented according to Maritime Administration procedures or in each contract file, as appropriate.</p>

<p>(d) The (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1, (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 and TAM do not apply to the Federal Aviation Administration as provided by the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996, Public Law 104-50, unless otherwise directed by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation.</p>

<p>(e) For purposes of the (FAR), (TAR) and (TAM), the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (formerly the Research and Innovative Technology Administration; see Public Law 113-76; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014) shall have the same authority as an Operating Administration as defined in (TAR) 1202.1, and the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology shall have the same authority as a Head of the Operating Administration as defined in (TAR) 1202.1</p>

<p>[70 FR 6507, Feb. 7, 2005, as amended at 79 FR 54627, Sept. 12, 2014]</p>

<p><a name="P17_2243"></a><b>1201.105-1 Publication and code arrangement.</b></p>

<p>(a) The (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 is published in: </p>

  <ul><p>(1) The Federal Register; and </p>

  <p>(2) Cumulative form in the CFR.</p>

</ul><p>(b) The TAR is issued as chapter 12 of Title 48 of the CFR</p>

<p><a name="P22_2455"></a><b>1201.105-2 Arrangement of regulations.</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>General.</i> The (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12, which encompasses both Department and Operating Administration (OA)/Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (OST-R)-specific guidance (see (TAR) 48 CFR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><a href="1201.htm#P52_6967">1201.3</a></u></font>), conforms with the arrangement and numbering system prescribed by <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#b1104. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.htm#P52_10622">(FAR) 48 CFR 1.104</a></u></font>. Guidance that is OA/OST-R-specific contains the OA/OST-R's acronym directly after the heading. The following acronyms apply:</p>

<p>FHWA—Federal Highway Administration</p>

<p>FMCSA—Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</p>

<p>FRA—Federal Railroad Administration</p>

<p>FTA—Federal Transit Administration</p>

<p>MARAD—Maritime Administration</p>

<p>NHTSA—National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</p>

<p>OST—Office of the Secretary OST-R—Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology</p>

<p>PHMSA—Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration</p>

<p>SLSDC—Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation</p>

<p>(b)<i><u>Numbering</u>.</i> &nbsp;(1) <i>Departmentwide guidance.&nbsp; </i>(i) The numbering illustrations at <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#b11052. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.htm#P63_11505">(FAR) 48 CFR 1.105-2</a></u></font> apply to (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12.</p>

<p>(ii) Coverage within (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 is identified by the prefix &quot;12&quot; followed by the complete (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 cite.&nbsp; For example, (TAR) 48 CFR 1201.201-1(b)).</p>

<p>(iii) Coverage in (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 that supplements (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 will use part, subpart, section and subsection numbers ending in &quot;70&quot; through &quot;89&quot; (e.g., (TAR) 48 CFR 1201.301-70).&nbsp; A series of numbers beginning with &quot;70&quot; is used for provisions and clauses.</p>

<p>(iv) Coverage in (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12, other than that identified with a &quot;70&quot; or higher number, that implements the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 uses the identical number sequence and caption of the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 segment being implemented, which may be to the paragraph level.&nbsp; Paragraph numbers and letters are not always shown sequentially, but may be shown by the specific FAR paragraph implemented.&nbsp; For example, (TAR) 48 CFR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><a href="1201.htm#P50_6827">1201.201-1</a></u></font> contains only paragraph (b) because only this paragraph, correlated with FAR, implements (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12).</p>

<p>(2) <i><u>Operating Administration-unique guidance</u>.</i> Supplementary material for which there is no counterpart in (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 or (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 shall be identified using chapter, part, subpart, section, or subsection numbers of &quot;90&quot; and higher.</p>

<p>(c) <i><u>References and citations</u>.</i> (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 may be referred to as the Department of Transportation Acquisition Regulation or the TAR. Cross reference to the FAR in (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 will be cited by &quot;FAR&quot; followed by the FAR numbered cite, and cross reference to the TAM in (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 will be cited by &quot;TAM&quot; followed by the TAM numbered cite. References to specific cites within (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 will be referenced by the numbered cite only.</p>

<p>(2) <i><u>Acquisition procedures</u>.</i> The SPE is the individual who issues or authorizes the issuance of internal agency guidance at any organizational level.&nbsp;&nbsp; DOT internal operating procedures are contained in the Transportation Acquisition Manual (TAM).&nbsp; OA procedures necessary to implement or supplement the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1, (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12, or TAM may be issued by the Head of the Contracting Agency (HCA), who may delegate this authority to any organizational level deemed appropriate. OA procedures may be more restrictive or require higher approval levels than those permitted by the TAM unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p>(b) The authority of the agency head under <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#b1301. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.htm#P893_29218">(FAR) 48 CFR 1.301</a></u></font>(b) to establish procedures to ensure that agency acquisition regulations are published for comment in the Federal Register in conformance with the procedures in FAR Subpart 1.5 is delegated to the Office of the General Counsel, Assistant General Counsel for Regulation and Enforcement (C-50).</p>

<p>(1) <u>Problem</u>: Succinctly state the problems created by current (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 language and describe the factual or legal reasons necessitating regulatory change.</p>

<p>(2) <u>Recommendation</u>: Identify the recommended change by using the current language (if applicable), and crossing out the deleted words with a horizontal line.&nbsp; Insert proposed language in brackets.&nbsp; If the change is extensive, deleted language may be displayed by forming a box with diagonal lines connecting the corners.</p>

<p>(3) <u>Discussion</u>: Explain why the change is necessary and how it will solve the problem. Address any cost or administrative impact on Government activities, offerors, and contractors. Provide any other information and documents such as statutes, legal decisions, regulations, reports, etc., that may be helpful.</p>

<p>(4) <u>Point of contact:</u>&nbsp; Provide a point of contact who can answer questions regarding the recommendation.</p>

<p>(b) The (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 is maintained by the SPE through the TAR/TAM change process.&nbsp; This process consists of input from various DOT elements including representatives from DOT OAs specifically designated to formulate Departmental acquisition policies and procedures).</p>

<p>(A) To quickly promulgate selected material in a general or narrative manner, in advance of a TAC issuance; </p>

<p>(B) To disseminate other acquisition related information; or</p>

<p>(C) To issue guidance which may be effective for a period of 1 year or less.</p>

<p>(ii) Each TN will expire by a specific date.</p>

<p>(b) Unless expressly directed by statute or regulation, solicitations in process or completed negotiations when the TAC or TN is received, new information such as forms and clauses, need not be included if the chief of the contracting office determines that it would not be in the best interest of the Government to include the new information.</p>

<p><a name="P75_11880"></a><b>1201.301-72 TAC or TN numbering.</b></p>

<p>TACs and TNs will be numbered consecutively on a fiscal year basis beginning with number &quot;01&quot; prefixed by the last two digits of the fiscal year (e.g., TNs 04-01 and 04-02 indicate the first two TNs issued in fiscal year 2004).</p>

<p><a name="P77_12139"></a><b>1201.304 Agency control and compliance procedures.</b></p>

<p>(a) DOT shall control the proliferation of acquisition regulations and any revisions thereto (except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section) by using an internal (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 change process that involves input from many DOT elements including OA representatives on the Procurement Management Council. The OA member shall represent their OA's viewpoint along with Departmentwide considerations in reaching a decision on (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 changes.</p>

<p>(b) OA-unique regulations will not be processed through the TAR/TAM change process, but shall be reviewed by OA legal counsel and submitted to the OSPE for review and approval. (See (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.101 for additional instructions pertaining to provisions and clauses.)</p>
