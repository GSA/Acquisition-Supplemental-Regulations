It is a system separate from the general Federal acquisition process for goods and services, but requires similar management and discipline to assure compliance with statutory requirements and considerations of equity and quality.  Its primary application is the acquisition of science, exploration, or technology space flight investigations via complete flight instrumentation and, where required, platform flight systems.</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-weight: bold;'> </span></p><p class="p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-weight: bold;'>1872.102 Key features of the system.</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(a)  Use of the system commences with the determination by the originating Mission Directorate Associate Administrator (MDAA) that the acquisition process is appropriate for a program (but see 1872.202).  The Announcement of Opportunity (AO) is recognized as a type of full and open competition (10 U.S.C. 2302 (2)(B)).  The AO is a form of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (see FAR 35.016 and 1835.016 for general BAA requirements) and supports an open, fair and transparent competitive evaluation and selection process that is based on review of proposals by peer scientists or other appropriate technical experts applying their communities’ standards of merit.  An AO does not specify the investigations to be proposed but solicits investigator ideas that can contribute to broad, publicly documented objectives.  A formal competitive evaluation process is utilized to determine which submitted proposal(s) shall be selected.  Evaluations for merit and feasibility are conducted by peer experts in the fields represented in the proposals.  Care is taken to avoid personal and organizational conflicts of interest, both actual and perceived.  Evaluators are chosen by NASA and may be from NASA, other Government agencies, universities, or the commercial sector, or other experts.  In addition to the evaluation for intrinsic merit and implementation merit and feasibility, aspects of engineering, cost, schedule, management, and risk are reviewed by specialists in those areas.  The evaluation results are combined with considerations of relevance and affordability and other programmatic factors to determine investigation(s) to be selected.</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(b)  The AO acquisition system incorporates the following key elements (“phases”) and component sub-elements (“processes”):</span></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span>(1)  The Announcement of Opportunity (see 1872.3)</span></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span>(2)  Evaluation of Proposals (see 1872.4; processes defined in 1872.401)<span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span></span></p><p class="p-Normal" style="text-indent: 36pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>(3)  Recommendation, Selection, and Debriefing (see 1872.5; processes defined in 1872.501).</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(c)  Some AO acquisitions are conducted using a two-step system, where a subset of submitted proposals are selected through the processes describe in 1872.408(a).</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-weight: bold;'>1872.103 Management authorities and responsibilities.</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(a)  For simplicity, this policy assumes that an acquisition is sponsored by a division within a directorate that is responsible for its execution.  The policy and its phases and processes can be mapped onto other organizational structures as needed.  The authorities and responsibilities for the major phases and their component processes emanate from the MDAA and are exercised as follows:</span></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span>(1)  The MDAA retains the authority and responsibility for final approval of the AO and its release as well as for proposal evaluation and resulting selection(s).</span></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span>(2)  The sponsoring division of a solicitation is responsible for development of the AO (see 1872.3), management and oversight of the assessment (see 1872.403) and Accommodation (see 1872.406) processes of the Evaluation phase as well as the recommendation (see 1872.502), and award, notification of proposers, and debriefing (see 1872.504) processes of the Recommendation, Selection, and Debriefing phase.  During AO preparation, the division is responsible for adapting (if necessary) the standard evaluation criteria (see 1872.402) and development of any optional specialty criteria required for the acquisition.  Examples of a specialty criterion would be an additional criterion for evaluating proposed technology demonstrations or student investigations.  The division designates a Division Program Acquisition Lead (AL) to carry out these functions.  <span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span></span></p><p class="p-Normal" style="text-indent: 36pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>(3)  The management and oversight of the categorization (see 1872.404) and validation (see 1872.405) processes of the evaluation phase, and of the selection process (see 1872.503) of the recommendation and selection phase, are the responsibility of a senior directorate-level official appointed by the MDAA as Directorate AL.  The Directorate designates a Technical, Management, and Cost (TMC) Acquisition Manager (TAM) to oversee the TMC assessments, including development of the TMC feasibility evaluation reports and to represent their results during subsequent acquisition phases.  During the acquisition process, the TAM works closely with the Division Program AL.</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(b)  The MDAA, or other Selection Official if designated by the MDAA, selects the proposal(s) that are to be funded for execution.</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(c)  The Principal Investigator (PI) on each selected proposal is assigned responsibility and authority for success of the investigation through a contract between NASA and his or her institution.  A contract is the preferred instrument for an AO award because the Agency’s investment in a flight investigation is large and only a contract provides sufficient enforcement and insight mechanisms to ensure that this investment is well managed.  However, for awards to a NASA Center or other Government entities, other appropriate instruments are used.  Participation by foreign investigators, or by U.S. investigators in a foreign program, is defined and governed on a no-exchange of funds basis by a formal international Space Act Agreement between NASA and the foreign sponsoring governmental agency or responsible entity (per NPD 1360.2).</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(d)  The MDAA may delegate Program Management responsibility for overseeing execution of the selected investigation(s) to a Program Office.</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-weight: bold;'>1872.104 Procurement integrity and conflicts of interest.</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(a)  Every participant in the AO process shall be individually responsible for following applicable standards of conduct.

These can be adjusted in an AO to suit the needs of its program goals.</span></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span>(2)  </span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-style: italic;'>Assessment</span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>. (see 1872.403)  The purpose of assessment is to determine the quality, relevance, and selectability of a proposed investigation in terms of science, exploration, or technology investigation intrinsic merit, implementation merit and feasibility, and TMC feasibility.  The TMC feasibility includes a cost risk assessment that incorporates an analysis of cost threats such as schedule and performance risk.</span></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span>(3)  </span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-style: italic;'>Categorization. </span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>(see 1872.404)  The purpose of categorization is to assign to each proposed investigation, based on the assessment results, an integrated appraisal of its overall selectability;</span></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span>(4)  </span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-style: italic;'>Validation. </span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>(see 1872.405)  The Validation phase reviews the end-to-end acquisition activity to this point, from the AO through Categorization.  The fundamental objective is to ensure that selection options that are presented to the Selection Official via the accommodation and recommendation phases have undergone a review that is expert, thorough, equitable, conflict-free, and defensible; and</span></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span>(5)  </span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-style: italic;'>Accommodation.</span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'> (see 1872.406 and 1872.407)  In some acquisitions, such as instrumentation for flight on a shared platform, system and operational constraints of various kinds (e.g. mass, power, location on the platform, pointing and viewing geometry, and thermal factors) may determine which instrument combinations are ultimately implementable, and therefore, selectable, for flight.  Accommodation analysis thus may impact downstream integrated payload Recommendation decisions.</span></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(b)  The assessment, categorization, and validation processes shall be accomplished in every investigation acquisition; the accommodation process shall be executed where applicable.  An overriding principle is the separation of the inputs, processes and criteria, and outputs for each of the sequential steps from assessment through accommodation.  Some latitude is afforded as long as this principle is maintained and the method employed clearly ensures the traits listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(c)  In general, several components of the Assessment process are conducted in parallel (see 1872.403).

For example, acquisitions for multiple instrumentation investigations for a tightly constrained legacy platform could have two Accommodation stages.  After Assessment or Categorization, an initial individual accommodation analysis can be performed for each favorably assessed instrument.  This could be followed by a second more comprehensive integrated accommodation analysis during the later recommendation process (see 1872.502) to identify implementable multi-instrument payload configurations.

The findings for each Factor are expressed in short narratives for identified Major Strengths, Minor Strengths, Major Weaknesses, and Minor Weaknesses.  The chair will also poll the members individually on their ratings for each of the Criteria on a standard scale and record them on its Criterion’s Forms (Form A for Criterion A, Form B for Criterion B, and Form C for Criterion C). “Comments to the Proposer” and “Comments to NASA” may be added; the latter are not provided to the proposers.</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(b)  Use of any approach other than the one defined in (a) above shall conform to the principles and constraints in sections 1872.105 and 1872.106 and requires consultation with the OGC and the OP and the approval of the MDAA.</span></p><p class="p-Normal"></p><p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(c)  </span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-style: italic;'>Products of the assessment process</span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>.

As a result, the Categorization process determining these ratings shall be conducted by a Headquarters committee of government employees that combines appropriate scientific, technical, and project management expertise with breadth and experience.  Only government employees may be appointed to the Categorization Committee.

In these cases, like proposals shall be gathered in the same panel to ensure that the competitive outcome between them is not affected by any inter-panel standards inconsistencies.
