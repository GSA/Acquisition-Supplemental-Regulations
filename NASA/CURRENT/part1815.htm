>(c)(6)(A)  Except for acquisitions described in 1815.300-70(b) contracting officers shall issue draft requests for proposals (DRFPs) for all competitive negotiated acquisitions expected to exceed $10,000,000 (including all options or later phases of the same project).  The contracting officer may waive the requirement for a DRFP upon written determination that the expected benefits will not be realized given the nature of the supply or service being acquired.  The requirement for a DRFP shall not be waived because of poor or inadequate planning.  DRFPs shall invite comments from potential offerors on all aspects of the draft solicitation, including the requirements, schedules, proposal instructions, and evaluation approaches.  Potential offerors should be specifically requested to identify unnecessary or inefficient requirements.  If the DRFP contains Government-unique standards, potential offerors should be invited to identify voluntary consensus standards that meet the Government's requirements as alternatives to Government-unique standards cited as requirements, in accordance with FAR 11.101 and OMB Circular A-119.  Comments should also be requested on any perceived safety, occupational health</span

Unless approved in writing by the procurement officer, the page limitation for the contracting portion of an RFP (all sections except Section C, Description/ specifications/work statement) shall not exceed 150 pages, and the page limitation for the technical portion (Section C) shall not exceed 200 pages.  Attachments to the RFP count as part of the section to which they relate.

Use by offerors of smaller font sizes for non-standard text (e.g. graphics, tables, charts, figures, captions, etc.) is permitted, if appropriate.  However, such fonts shall be no smaller than 8-point, shall be utilized only where appropriate, and shall not be utilized to circumvent or avoid RFP proposal page limitations.

The contracting officer shall return one copy of the excess pages removed from the proposal to the offeror, advising the offeror that they were over the limit and will not be evaluated.

>(a)(1)  For sole source procurement actions, when requiring data other than certified cost or pricing data, contracting officers must clearly communicate to the contractor the data that will be needed to determine that the proposed price is fair and reasonable.  The contracting officer should allow contractors to submit such data in the format consistent with their disclosed estimating practices and shall not require the contractor to use Government price/cost templates, models, or forms.  For competitive procurement actions, when requesting data other than certified cost or pricing data, the use of price/cost templates, models, or forms is authorized in those situations where the contracting officer determines, with the concurrence of the </span

>(a)(4)  A contractor that refuses to provide requested data other than certified cost or pricing data may be rendered ineligible for award unless the Head of the Contracting Activity determines otherwise, in accordance with FAR 15.403-3(a)(4).  As such, it is important that contractor refusals to provide requested pricing information receive the attention of management at levels higher than the contracting officer, and that contracting officer’s document the extent of their efforts to obtain the requested data.  In these circumstances, the basis for the agreed-to price may not be an appropriate basis for comparison in determining price reasonableness in future procurements.  Contracting officers should request the necessary data other than certified cost or pricing data again in future procurements of this item/service and not just rely on the prior price as being a valid basis for determining price reasonableness on future procurements.</span

For firm-fixed-price competitions, the contracting officer shall not request any cost data, except for the data specifically required by FAR 22.1103, unless cost analysis is warranted, as permitted by FAR 15.404-1(d)(3).  Cost analysis may be warranted in those situations where the price analysis indicated that the requirements may not be fully understood by one or more competing offeror(s) such as when proposed price(s) appear unreasonable or unrealistically low in consideration of the proposed approach(es) giving rise to concerns of poor quality, service shortfalls, or potential default.  Under firm-fixed price service contract competitions, labor rate and fringe benefit data may be obtained to be used in future wage determination adjustments under FAR 52.222-41 and FAR 52.222-6.  This data, when requested, does not necessarily need to be part of the competition’s price evaluation.</span
