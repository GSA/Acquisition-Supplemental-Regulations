      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) The contracting officer shall not complete the initial evaluation of any proposal when it is determined that the proposal is unacceptable because:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) It does not represent a reasonable initial effort to address the essential requirements of the RFP or clearly demonstrates that the offeror does not understand the requirements;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) In research and development acquisitions, a substantial design drawback is evident in the proposal, and sufficient correction or improvement to consider the proposal acceptable would require virtually an entirely new technical proposal; or
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) It contains major deficiencies or omissions or out-of-line costs which discussions with the offeror could not reasonably be expected to cure.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) The contracting officer shall document the rationale for discontinuing the initial evaluation of a proposal in accordance with this section.
