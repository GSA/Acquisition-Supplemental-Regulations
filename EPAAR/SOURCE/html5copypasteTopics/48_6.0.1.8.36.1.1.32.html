                                 <p class="p List1">(a) The Government will order any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract by issuing task/delivery orders on Optional Form 347, or an agency prescribed form, from ___ through ___. In addition to the Contracting Officer, the following individuals are authorized ordering officers.

                                 <p class="p List1">(b) A Standard Form 30 will be the method of amending task/delivery orders.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) The Contractor shall acknowledge receipt of each order by having an authorized company officer sign either a copy of a transmittal letter or signature block on page 3 of the task/delivery order, depending upon which is provided, within __ calendar days of receipt.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) Prior to the placement of any task/delivery order, the Contractor will be provided with a proposed Performance Work Statement/Statement of Work and will be asked to respond with detailed technical and cost proposals within __ calendar days or less. The technical proposal will delineate the Contractor's interpretation for the execution of the PWS/SOW, and the pricing proposal will be the Contractor's best estimate for the hours, labor categories and all costs associated with the execution. The proposals are subject to negotiation. The Ordering Officer and the Contractor shall reach agreement on all the material terms of each order prior to the order being issued.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) Each task/delivery order issued will incorporate the Contractor's technical and cost proposals as negotiated with the Government, and will have a ceiling price which the contractor shall not exceed. When the Contractor has reason to believe that the labor payment and support costs for the order which will accrue in the next thirty (30) days will bring total cost to over 85 percent of the ceiling price specified in the order, the Contractor shall notify the Ordering Officer.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) Under no circumstances will the Contractor start work prior to the issue date of the task/delivery order unless specifically authorized to do so by the Ordering Officer. Any verbal authorization will be confirmed in writing by the Ordering Officer or Contracting Officer within __ calendar days.</p>
