                                 <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Definition.</em> Information Resources Management (IRM) is defined as any planning, budgeting, organizing, directing, training, promoting, controlling, and managing activities associated with the burden, collection, creation, use and dissemination of information.

Examples of these services include but are not limited to the following:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) The acquisition, creation, or modification of a computer program or automated data base for delivery to EPA or use by EPA or contractors operating EPA programs.
