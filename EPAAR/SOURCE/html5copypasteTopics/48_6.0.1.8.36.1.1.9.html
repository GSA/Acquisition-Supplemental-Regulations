Except as specifically provided in this clause, the Contractor shall be free to compete for contracts on an equal basis with other companies.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) The following applies when work is performed under this contract: Unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the Contractor, during the life of the work assignment, task order, or tasking document and for a period of five (5) years after the completion of the work assignment, task order, or tasking document, agrees not to enter into a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to: (1) Any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under this contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) The Contractor and any subcontractors, during the life of this contract, shall be ineligible to enter into an EPA contract or a subcontract under an EPA contract, which supports EPA's performance of Superfund Headquarters policy work including support for the analysis and development of regulations, policies, or guidance that govern, affect, or relate to the conduct of response action activities, unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer. Examples of such contracts include, but are not limited to, Superfund Management and Analytical support contracts, and Superfund Technical and Analytical support contracts.

Therefore, no claim shall be made against the Government to recover bid/proposal costs as a direct cost whether the request for authorization to enter into the contract is denied or approved.
</p>

An adverse determination resulting from a request for reconsideration by the Contracting Officer will not preclude the contractor from requesting a review by the next administrative level. Either a request for review or a request for reconsideration must be submitted to the appropriate level within 30 calendar days after receipt of the initial adverse determination.</p>

                                 <p class="p List1">(c) The Contractor, during the life of this contract, will be ineligible to enter into a contract with EPA to perform response action work (e.g., Response Action Contract (RAC), Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS), Superfund Technical Assistance and Removal Team (START), and Enforcement Support Services (ESS) contracts), unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) The Contractor agrees in advance that if any bids/proposals are submitted for any work that would require written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into a contract subject to the restrictions of this clause, then the bids/proposals are submitted at the Contractor's own risk.

                                 <p class="p List1">(f) The Contractor agrees to insert in each subcontract or consultant agreement placed hereunder, except for subcontracts or consultant agreements for nondiscretionary technical or engineering services, including treatability studies, well drilling, fence erecting, plumbing, utility hookups, security guard services, or electrical services, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (f) unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor may request in writing that the Contracting Officer exempt from this clause a particular subcontract or consultant agreement for nondiscretionary technical or engineering services not specifically listed above, including laboratory analysis.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(g) If the Contractor seeks an expedited decision regarding its initial future contracting request, the Contractor may submit its request to both the Contracting Officer and the next administrative level within the Contracting Officer's organization.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(h) A review process available to the Contractor when an adverse determination is received shall consist of a request for reconsideration to the Contracting Officer or a request for review submitted to the next administrative level within the Contracting Officer's organization. An adverse determination resulting from a request for reconsideration by the Contracting Officer will not preclude the Contractor from requesting a review by the next administrative level. Either a request for review or a request for reconsideration must be submitted to the appropriate level within 30 calendar days after receipt of the initial adverse determination.</p>
