A personal conflict of interest is defined as a relationship of an employee, subcontractor employee, or consultant with an entity that may impair the objectivity of the employee, subcontractor employee, or consultant in performing the contract work.

In the event that the personal conflict of interest does not become known until after performance on the contract begins, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer of the personal conflict of interest. The Contractor shall continue performance of this contract until notified by the Contracting Officer of the appropriate action to be taken.
