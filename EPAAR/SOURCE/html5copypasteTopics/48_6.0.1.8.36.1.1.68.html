</p>
                                 <p class="p P">The Contractor shall handle Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) confidential business information (CBI) in accordance with the contract clause entitled “Treatment of Confidential Business Information” and “Screening Business Information for Claims of Confidentiality.”
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) The Project Officer (PO) or his/her designee, after a written determination by the appropriate program office, may disclose TSCA CBI to the contractor necessary to carry out the work required under this contract. The Contractor shall protect all TSCA CBI to which it has access (including CBI used in its computer operations) in accordance with the following requirements:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) The Contractor and Contractor's employees shall follow the security procedures set forth in the TSCA CBI Security Manual. The manual may be obtained from the Director, Information Management Division (IMD), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. Prior to receipt of TSCA CBI by the Contractor, the Contractor shall ensure that all employees who will be cleared for access to TSCA CBI have been briefed on the handling, control, and security requirements set forth in the TSCA CBI Security Manual. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor shall permit access to and inspection of the Contractor's facilities in use under this contract by representatives of EPA's Assistant Administrator for Administration and Resources Management, and the TSCA Security Staff in the OPPT, or by the EPA Project Officer.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) The Contractor Document Control Officer (DCO) shall obtain a signed copy of EPA Form 7740-6, “TSCA CBI Access Request, Agreement, and Approval,” from each of the Contractor's employees who will have access to the information before the employee is allowed access. In addition, the Contractor shall obtain from each employee who will be cleared for TSCA CBI access all information required by EPA or the U.S. Office of Personnel Management for EPA to conduct a Minimum Background Investigation.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) The Contractor agrees that these requirements concerning protection of TSCA CBI are included for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, both EPA and any affected business having a proprietary interest in the information.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) The Contractor understands that CBI obtained by EPA under TSCA may not be disclosed except as authorized by the Act, and that any unauthorized disclosure by the Contractor or the Contractor's employees may subject the Contractor and the Contractor's employees to the criminal penalties specified in TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2613(d)). For purposes of this contract, the only disclosures that EPA authorizes the Contractor to make are those set forth in the clause entitled “Treatment of Confidential Business Information.”
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) The Contractor agrees to include the provisions of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts awarded pursuant to this contract that require the furnishing of CBI to the subcontractor.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) At the request of EPA or at the end of the contract, the Contractor shall return to the EPA PO or his/her designee, all documents, logs, and magnetic media which contain TSCA CBI. In addition, each Contractor employee who has received TSCA CBI clearance will sign EPA Form 7740-18, “Confidentiality Agreement for Contractor Employees Upon Relinquishing TSCA CBI Access Authority.” The Contractor DCO will also forward those agreements to the EPA OPPT/IMD, with a copy to the CO, at the end of the contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) If, subsequent to the date of this contract, the Government changes the security requirements, the CO shall equitably adjust affected provisions of this contract, in accordance with the “Changes” clause, when:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) The Contractor submits a timely written request for an equitable adjustment; and,
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The facts warrant an equitable adjustment.</p>
