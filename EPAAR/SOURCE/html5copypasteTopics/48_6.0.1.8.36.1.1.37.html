The Contracting Officer is responsible for the overall award term evaluation and award term decision. The Contracting Officer will unilaterally decide whether or not the contractor is eligible for an award term extension, and in conjunction with the Contracting Officer's Representative, will determine the need for continued performance and funding availability.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Period of performance.</em> Provided the contractor has achieved the performance measures, e.g., acceptable quality levels, set forth in the clause “Award Term Incentive Plan,” the Contracting Officer may extend the contract by exercising ____ [insert the total award term incentive periods] additional award term incentive period(s) of ____ [insert the award term incentive period] months each. The total maximum period of performance under this contract, if the Government exercises any option periods and all award term incentive periods is ____ [insert the total of the base period, option periods (if any), and award term incentive periods] years.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) The Contracting Officer has failed to initiate an award term incentive period, regardless of whether the contractor's performance permitted the Contracting Officer to consider initiating the award term incentive period; or

                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) The contractor has failed to achieve the performance measures for the corresponding evaluation period; or
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) The Government notifies the contractor in writing it does not have funds available for the award term incentive periods; or

                                 <p class="p List3">(iv) The Government no longer has a need for the award term incentive period at or before the time an award term incentive period is to commence.

                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Subsequent award term incentive periods are thereby also cancelled.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) Cancellation of an award term incentive period that has not yet commenced for any of the reasons set forth in paragraph (c) of this clause shall not be considered either a termination for convenience or termination for default, and shall not entitle the contractor to any termination settlement or any other compensation. If the award term incentive is cancelled, a unilateral modification will cite this clause as the authority.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Award term incentive administration.</em> The award term incentive evaluation(s) will be completed in accordance with the schedule in the Award Term Incentive Plan. The contractor will be notified of the results and their eligibility to be considered for the respective award term incentive no later than 120 days after an evaluation period.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Review process.</em> The contractor may request a review of an award term incentive evaluation which has resulted in the contractor being ineligible for the award term incentive.
