In addition to performing the duties outlined in paragraph (c) of this section that are normally performed in the activity to which assigned, the SBS shall perform such additional functions as may be prescribed from time to time in furtherance of overall small business programs goals.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Take action to assure the availability of adequate specifications and drawings, when necessary, to obtain small business participation in an acquisition.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Review proposed contracts for possible breakout of items or services suitable for acquisition from small business concerns;
