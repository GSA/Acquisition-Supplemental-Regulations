         <p class="p P">This subpart establishes EPA policy and procedures for identifying, evaluating, and resolving organizational conflicts of interest.

         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Disclosure.</em> Prospective EPA Contractors responding to solicitations or submitting unsolicited proposals shall provide information to the Contracting Officer for use in identifying, evaluating, or resolving potential organizational conflicts of interest. The submittal may be a certification or a disclosure, pursuant to paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) If the prospective contractor is not aware of any information bearing on the existence of any organizational conflict of interest, it may so certify.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Prospective contractors not certifying in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section must provide a disclosure statement which describes concisely all relevant facts concerning any past, present, or planned interests relating to the work to be performed and bearing on whether they, including their chief executives, directors, or any proposed consultant or subcontractor, may have a potential organizational conflict of interest.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Failure to disclose information.</em> Any prospective contractor failing to provide full disclosure, certification, or other required information will not be eligible for award. Nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant information may also result in disqualification from award, termination of the contract for default, or debarment from Government contracts, as well as other legal action or prosecution. In response to solicitations, EPA will consider any inadvertent failure to provide disclosure certification as a “minor informality” (as explained in FAR 14.405); however, the prospective contractor must correct the omission promptly.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Exception.</em> Where the Contractor has previously submitted a conflict of interest certification or disclosure for a contract, only an update of such statement is required when the contract is modified.

The term “RAC” in the Limitation of Future Contracting clauses includes not only RAC solicitations and contracts but other long term response action solicitations and contracts that provide professional architect/engineer, technical, and management services to EPA to support remedial response, enforcement oversight and non-time critical removal activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments Reauthorization Act of 1986; and the Robert T.

This clause requires an annual conflict of interest certification from contractors when the contract does not require the submission of other conflict of interest certifications during contract performance. Contracts requiring annual certifications include: Site Specific contracts, the Contract Laboratory Program (CLP), and the Sample Management Office (SMO) contracts. The annual certification requires a contractor to certify that all organizational conflicts of interest have been reported, and that its personnel performing work under EPA contracts or relating to EPA contracts have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts of interest to the Contractor. The annual certification shall cover the one-year period from the date of contract award for the initial certification, and a one-year period starting from the previous certification for subsequent certifications. The certification must be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 45 days after the close of the certification period covered.
