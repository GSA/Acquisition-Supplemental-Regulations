         <p outputclass="P">Records retained by FEHBP carriers on Federal subscribers and members of their families serve the carriers' own commercial function of paying health benefits claims and are not maintained to accomplish an agency function of OPM. Consequently, the records do not fall within the provisions of the Privacy Act. Nevertheless, OPM recognizes the need for carriers to keep certain records confidential. The clause at 1652.224-70 shall be inserted in all FEHBP contracts.
