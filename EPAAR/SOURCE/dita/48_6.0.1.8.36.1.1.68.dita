The manual may be obtained from the Director, Information Management Division (IMD), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. Prior to receipt of TSCA CBI by the Contractor, the Contractor shall ensure that all employees who will be cleared for access to TSCA CBI have been briefed on the handling, control, and security requirements set forth in the TSCA CBI Security Manual.

For purposes of this contract, the only disclosures that EPA authorizes the Contractor to make are those set forth in the clause entitled “Treatment of Confidential Business Information.”
