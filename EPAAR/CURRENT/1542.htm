<p> (a) Any EPA contracting office upon being notified of a successor in interest to, or change of name of, one of its Contractors shall promptly report such information by memorandum to the Director, Policy, Training and Oversight Division (POTD). </p>

<p>(b) To avoid duplication of effort on the part of EPA contracting offices in preparing and executing agreements to recognize a change of name or successor in interest, only one supplemental agreement will be prepared to effect necessary changes for all contracts between EPA and the Contractor involved. The Chief of the Procurement Policy Branch, Policy, Training and Oversight Division (PTOD), will, in each case, designate the Contracting Office responsible for taking all necessary and appropriate action with respect to either recognizing or not recognizing a successor in interest, or recognizing a change of name agreement.</p>

<p>(3) Draft and execute a supplemental agreement to one of the contracts affected but covering all applicable outstanding and incomplete contracts affected by the transfer of assets or change of name. A supplemental agreement number need not be obtained for contracts other than for the one under which the supplemental agreement is written. The supplemental agreement will contain a list of the contracts affected and, for distribution purposes, the names and addresses of the contracting offices having contracts subject to the supplemental agreement. </p>

<p>(b) Agreements and supporting documents covering successors in interest shall be reviewed for legal sufficiency by legal counsel. </p>

<p>(c) After execution of the supplemental agreement, the designated office shall forward an authenticated copy of the supplemental agreement to the Director, Policy, Training and Oversight Division, and to each affected contract office. </p>

<p><b>Source:</b>   76 FR 39017, July 5, 2011, unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p><a name="P40_4444"></a><b>1542.1500   Scope of subpart.</b></p>

<p>This subpart provides EPA policies and establishes responsibilities for recording and maintaining contractor performance information.</p>

<p><a name="P42_4606"></a><b>1542.1502   Policy.</b></p>

<p>EPA contracting officers shall prepare an evaluation of contractor performance for all applicable contracts and orders with a total estimated value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold in accordance with FAR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR42.doc#b421502. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/42.htm#P770_110388">42.1502</a></u></font>. For acquisitions involving options, the total estimated value of the acquisition shall include the estimated base amount plus the option(s) amount(s). Evaluations shall be completed no later than 120 days after the end of the evaluation period.</p>

<p><a name="P44_5099"></a><b>1542.1503   Procedures.</b></p>

<p> (a) <i>Past Performance Database. </i>EPA contracting officers shall use the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) which has connectivity with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).</p>

<p>(b) <i>Frequency and Types of Report. </i>CPARS includes four types of reports: Initial, Intermediate, Final and Out-of-Cycle.</p>

<p>(1) An initial report is required for new contracts/orders meeting the thresholds in FAR 42.15 with a period of performance greater than 365 days. The initial CPAR must reflect evaluation of at least the first 180 days of performance and may include up to the first 365 days of performance.</p>

<p>(2) Intermediate reports are due every 12 months throughout the entire period of the contract after the initial report and up to the final report. While formal reports are only required every 12 months, contracting officers should discuss past performance with contractors on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>(3) A final report shall be prepared upon contract completion. Contracts/orders with less than 365 days performance only require a final report. For contracts longer than 365 days, the final report is not cumulative and covers only the period of performance following the last intermediate report. Final past performance reports must be completed prior to contract closeout.</p>

<p>(4) An out-of-cycle report may be prepared when there is a significant change of performance that alters the assessment in one or more evaluation areas. The contractor may request an Out-of-cycle report be prepared; however, the decision of whether or not to do so is at the discretion of the contracting officer. An out-of-cycle report does not alter the annual intermediate reporting requirement.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Preparing the Evaluation. </i>The contracting officer's representative shall initiate all reviews and forward to the contracting officer for approval. The content of the evaluations shall be based on objective data supportable by program and contract management records. Remarks should be tailored to the contract type, size, content, and complexity. Contracting officers should provide their own input on the evaluation as applicable and obtain input from the program office, administrative contracting office, end users of the product or service, and any other technical or business advisor, as appropriate.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Small Business Subcontracting Plan. </i>Evaluations shall include an assessment of contractor performance against and efforts to achieve the goals identified in the small business subcontracting plan when the contract includes the clause at FAR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR52.215.doc#b522199. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/52_215.htm#P1593_251321">52.219–9</a></u></font>, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.</p>

<p>(e) <i>Novation Agreements/Name Changes. </i>In cases of novations involving successors-in-interest, a final evaluation of the predecessor contractor's performance must be accomplished. The predecessor contractor's final past performance report shall cover the last 12 months (or less) of contract or order performance. In cases of change-of-name agreements, the system shall be changed to reflect the new contractor's name.</p>

<p>(f) <i>File Documentation. </i>Copies of the evaluation, contractor response, and review comments (if any) shall be retained as part of the evaluation, and hard copies shall be contained in contract files.</p>
