<p>Printing (SEP 2012)</p>

<p>(a) <i>Definitions.</i> “Printing” is the process of composition, plate making, presswork, binding and microform; or the end items produced by such processes and equipment. Printing services include newsletter production and periodicals which are prohibited under EPA contracts. </p>

<p>“Composition” applies to the setting of type by hot-metal casting, photo typesetting, or electronic character generating devices for the purpose of producing camera copy, negatives, a plate or image to be used in the production of printing or microform. </p>

<p>“Camera copy” (or “camera-ready copy”) is a final document suitable for printing/duplication. </p>

<p>“Desktop Publishing” is a method of composition using computers with the final output or generation of a camera copy done by a color inkjet or color laser printer. This is not considered “printing.” However, if the output from desktop publishing is being sent to a typesetting device (<i>i.e.,</i> Linotronic) with camera copy being produced in either paper or negative format, these services are considered “printing”. </p>

<p>“Microform” is any product produced in a miniaturized image format, for mass or general distribution and as a substitute for conventionally printed material. Microform services are classified as printing services and include microfiche and microfilm. The contractor may make up to two sets of microform files for archival purposes at the end of the contract period of performance. </p>

<p>“Duplication” means the making of copies on photocopy machines employing electrostatic, thermal, or other processes without using an intermediary such as a negative or plate. </p>

<p>“Requirement” means an individual photocopying task. (There may be multiple requirements under a Work Assignment or Delivery Order. Each requirement would be subject to the duplication limitation of 5,000 copies of one page or 25,000 copies of multiple pages in the aggregate per requirement). </p>

<p>“Incidental” means a draft and/or proofed document (not a final document) that is not prohibited from printing under EPA contracts.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Prohibition.</i> (1) The contractor shall not engage in, nor subcontract for, any printing in connection with the performance of work under this contract. Duplication of more than 5,000 copies of one page or more than 25,000 copies of multiple pages in the aggregate per requirement constitutes printing. The intent of the printing limitation is to eliminate duplication of final documents.</p>

<p>(2) In compliance with EPA Order 2200.4a, EPA Publication Review Procedure, the Office of Communications, Education, and Media Relations is responsible for the review of materials generated under a contract published or issued by the Agency under a contract intended for release to the public.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Affirmative Requirements.</i> (1) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, the contractor shall use double-sided copying to produce any progress report, draft report or final report. </p>

<p>(2) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, the contractor shall use recycled paper for reports delivered to the Agency which meet the minimum content standards for paper and paper products as set forth in EPA's Web site for the Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines at: <i>http://www.epa.gov/cpg/.</i></p>

<p>(d) <i>Permitted Contractor Activities.</i> (1) The prohibitions contained in paragraph (b) do not preclude writing, editing, or preparing manuscript copy, or preparing related illustrative material to a final document (camera-ready copy) using desktop publishing. </p>

<p>(2) The contractor may perform a requirement involving the duplication of less than 5,000 copies of only one page, or less than 25,000 copies of multiple pages in the aggregate, using one color (black), such pages shall not exceed the maximum image size of 103⁄4 by 141⁄4 inches, or 11 by 17 paper stock. Duplication services below these thresholds are not considered printing. If performance of the contract will require duplication in excess of these thresholds, contractors must immediately notify the contracting officer in writing and a waiver must be obtained. Only the Joint Committee on Printing has the authority to grant waivers to the printing requirements. All Agency waiver requests must be coordinated with EPA's Headquarters Printing Management Team, Facilities and Services Division, and with the Office of General Counsel. Duplication services of “incidentals” in excess of the thresholds are allowable.</p>

<p>(3) The contractor may perform a requirement involving the multi-color duplication of no more than 100 pages in the aggregate using color copier technology, such pages shall not exceed the maximum image size of 103⁄4 by 141⁄4 inches, or 11 by 17 paper stock. Duplication services below these thresholds are not considered printing. If performance of the contract will require duplication in excess of these limits, contractors must immediately notify the contracting officer in writing and a waiver must be obtained. Only the Joint Committee on Printing has the authority to grant waivers to the printing requirements. All Agency waiver requests must be coordinated with EPA's Headquarters Printing Management Team, Facilities and Services Division, and with the Office of General Counsel.</p>

<p>(4) The contractor may perform the duplication of no more than a total of 500 units of an electronic information storage device (e.g., CD-ROMs, DVDs, thumb drives1) (including labeling and packaging) per work assignment or task order/delivery order per contract year. Duplication services below these thresholds are not considered printing. If performance of the contract will require duplication in excess of these thresholds, contractors must immediately notify the contracting officer in writing and a waiver must be obtained. Only the Joint Committee on Printing has the authority to grant waivers to the printing requirements. All Agency waiver requests must be coordinated with EPA's Headquarters Printing Management Team, Facilities and Services Division, and with the Office of General Counsel.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Pursuant to the July 2008 guidance Promotional Communications for EPA, a thumb drive can be used as a promotional item, but it also must be an information medium in itself. Namely, it must have substantive EPA information already loaded into the drive. Due to its intrinsic material value, it may not be used simply or primarily to display an EPA message on the exterior of the drive.</p>

<p>(e) <i>Violations.</i> The contractor may not engage in, nor subcontract for, any printing in connection with the performance of work under the contract. The cost of any printing services in violation of this clause will be disallowed, or not accepted by the Government. </p>

<p>(f) <i>Flowdown Clause.</i> The contractor shall include in each subcontract which may involve a requirement for any printing/duplicating/copying a provision substantially the same as this clause.</p>

<p>(b) Prior to commencement of any work, the Contractor agrees to notify the Contracting Officer immediately that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, no actual or potential conflict of interest exists or to identify to the Contracting Officer any actual or potential conflict of interest the firm may have. In emergency situations, however, work may begin but notification shall be made within five (5) working days. </p>

<p>(c) The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest is identified during performance, the Contractor will immediately make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict of interest. The Contractor shall continue performance until notified by the Contracting Officer of any contrary action to be taken. </p>

<p>(d) Remedies—The EPA may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential organizational conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose it or misprepresented relevant information to the Contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. </p>

<p>(b) The Contractor will be ineligible to enter into a contract for remedial action projects for which the Contractor has developed the statement of work or the solicitation package. </p>

<p>(c) The following applies when work is performed under this contract: Unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the Contractor, during the life of the work assignment, task order, or tasking document and for a period of five (5) years after the completion of the work assignment, task order, or tasking document, agrees not to enter into a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to: (1) Any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under this contract.</p>

Examples of such contracts include, but are not limited to, Superfund Management and Analytical support contracts, and Superfund Technical and Analytical support contracts.</p>

<p>(e) The Contractor agrees in advance that if any bids/proposals are submitted for any work that would require written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into a contract subject to the restrictions of this clause, then the bids/proposals are submitted at the Contractor's own risk. Therefore, no claim shall be made against the Government to recover bid/proposal costs as a direct cost whether the request for authorization to enter into the contract is denied or approved.</p>

<p>Level of Effort--Cost-Reimbursement Contract (May 2016)</p>

<p>(a) The Contractor shall perform all work and provide all required reports within the level of effort specified below. The Contractor shall provide up to ____ direct labor hours for the base period. The Government's best estimate of the level of effort to fulfill these requirements is provided for advisory and estimating purposes. The Government is only obligated to pay for direct labor hours ordered and corresponding fixed fee for labor hours completed.</p>

<p>(b) Direct labor includes personnel such as engineers, scientists, draftsmen, technicians, statisticians, and programmers, and not support personnel such as company management or data entry/word processing/accounting personnel even though such support personnel are normally treated as direct labor by the Contractor. The level of effort specified in paragraph (a) of this section includes Contractor, subcontractor, and consultant non-support labor hours.</p>

<p>(c) If the Contractor provides less than 90 percent of the level of effort specified for the base period or any optional period exercised, an equitable downward adjustment of the fixed fee, if any, for that period will be made. The downward adjustment will reduce the fixed fee by the percentage by which the total expended level of effort is less than 100% of that specified in paragraph (a). (For instance, if a hypothetical base-period LOE of 100,000 hours is being reduced to 70,000, the fixed fee shall also be reduced by the same 30%. Using a corresponding hypothetical base-period fixed fee pool of $300,000, the reduced fixed-fee amount is calculated as: $300,000 x (70,000 hours/100,000 hours) = $210,000.)</p>

<p>(d) The Government may require the Contractor to provide additional effort up to 110 percent of the level of effort for any period until the estimated cost for that period has been reached. However, this additional effort shall not result in any increase in the fixed fee, if any.</p>

<p>(e) If this is a cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF) contract, the term ``fee'' in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section means ``base fee and incentive fee.'' If this is a cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract, the term ``fee'' in paragraphs (c) and (d) means ``base fee and award fee.''</p>

<p>(f) If the level of effort specified to be ordered during a given base or option period is not ordered during that period, that level of effort may not be accumulated and ordered during a subsequent period.</p>

<p>(g) These terms and conditions do not supersede the requirements of either the ``Limitation of Cost'' or ``Limitation of Funds'' clauses.</p>

<p>Work Assignments (DEC 2014)</p>

<p>(a) The contractor shall perform work under this contract as specified in written work assignments issued by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(b) Each work assignment may include (1) a numerical designation, (2) approved workplan labor hours or an estimated initial level of effort provided in accordance with 1511.011-74, (3) the period of performance and schedule of deliverables, and (4) the description of the work.</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor shall acknowledge receipt of each work assignment by returning to the Contracting Officer a signed copy of the work assignment within ___ calendar days after its receipt. The Contractor shall begin working on a work plan immediately upon receipt of a work assignment. Within ___ calendar days after receipt of a work assignment, the Contractor shall submit ___ copies of a work plan to the Contract-level Contracting Officer's Representative and ___ copies to the Contracting Officer. The work plan shall include a detailed technical and staffing plan and a detailed cost estimate. Within ___ calendar days after receipt of the work plan, the Contracting Officer will provide written approval or disapproval of it to the Contractor. The Contractor is not authorized to start work without an approved work plan unless approved by the Contracting Officer or otherwise specified. Also, if the Contracting Officer disapproves a work plan, the Contractor shall stop work until the problem causing the disapproval is resolved. In either case, the Contractor shall resume work only when the Contracting Officer approves the work plan.</p>

<p>(d) This clause does not change the requirements of the ``Level of Effort'' clause, nor the notification requirements of either the ``Limitation of Cost'' or ``Limitation of Funds'' clauses.</p>

<p>(e) Work assignments shall not allow for any change to the terms or conditions of the contract. Where any language in the work assignment may suggest a change to the terms or conditions, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>Alternate I. As prescribed in 1511.011-74, modify the existing clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:</p>

<p>(f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict of interest (COI) certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are issued under this contract for work on or directly related to a site, the Contractor is only required to provide a COI certification for the first work assignment issued for that site. For all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor has a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential COIs, but no additional COI certifications are required.</p>

<p>Before submitting the COI certification, the Contractor shall search its records accumulated, at a minimum, over the past three years immediately prior to the receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document. In the COI certification, the Contractor must certify to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief that all actual or potential organizational COIs have been reported to the Contracting Officer, or that to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, no actual or potential organizational COIs exist. In addition, the Contractor must certify that its personnel who perform work under this work assignment or relating to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational COIs to the Contractor.

Once three years of records have accumulated, prior to certifying, the Contractor shall search its records accumulated, at a minimum, over the past three years immediately prior to the receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document. In the COI certification, the Contractor must certify to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that all actual or potential organizational COIs have been reported to the Contracting Officer, or that to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, no actual or potential organizational COIs exist.

<p>(f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict of interest (COI) certification.</p>

<p><b>Compliance With EPA Policies for Information Resources Management (JUL 2016)</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Definition</i>. Information Resources Management (IRM) is defined as any planning, budgeting, organizing, directing, training, promoting, controlling, and managing activities associated with the burden, collection, creation, use and dissemination of information. IRM includes both information itself and the management of information and related resources such as personnel, equipment, funds, and technology. Examples of these services include but are not limited to the following:</p>

<p>(1) The acquisition, creation, or modification of a computer program or automated data base for delivery to EPA or use by EPA or contractors operating EPA programs.</p>

<p>(2) The analysis of requirements for, study of the feasibility of, evaluation of alternatives for, or design and development of a computer program or automated data base for use by EPA or contractors operating EPA programs.</p>

<p>(3) Services that provide EPA personnel access to or use of computer or word processing equipment, software, or related services.</p>

<p>(4) Services that provide EPA personnel access to or use of: Data communications; electronic messaging services or capabilities; electronic bulletin boards, or other forms of electronic information dissemination; electronic record-keeping; or any other automated information services.</p>

<p>(b) General. The Contractor shall perform any IRM-related work under this contract in accordance with the IRM policies, standards, and procedures set forth on the Office of Environmental Information policy Web site. Upon receipt of a work request (i.e. delivery order, task order, or work assignment), the Contractor shall check this listing of directives. The applicable directives for performance of the work request are those in effect on the date of issuance of the work request. The 2100 Series (2100-2199) of the Agency's Directive System contains the majority of the Agency's IRM policies, standards, and procedures.</p>

<p>(c) Section 508 requirements (accessibility). Contract deliverables are required to be compliant with Section 508 requirements (accessibility for people with disabilities). The Environmental Protection Agency policy for 508 compliance can be found at <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .http://www.epa.gov/accessibility. --><a href="http://www.epa.gov/accessibility">www.epa.gov/accessibility</a></u></font>.</p>

<p>Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals (AUG 1999)</p>

<p>(a) <i>Other than cost proposal instructions.</i>(1) Submit proposal for than cost factors as a separate part of the total proposal package. Omit all cost or pricing details from this proposal.</p>

<p>(2) Special proposal instructions:</p>

<p>____________________<br>
____________________<br>
____________________</p>

<p>(b) Cost or pricing proposal instructions. The offeror shall prepare and submit cost or pricing information data and supporting attachments in accordance with Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408. In addition to a hard copy of the information, to expedite review of the proposal, submit an IBM-compatible software or storage device (e.g., USB flash drive or card reader) containing the financial data required, if this information is available using a commercial spreadsheet program on a personal computer. Submit this information using Microsoft Exchange 365, if available. Identify which version of Microsoft Exchange used. If the offeror used another spreadsheet program, indicate the software program used to create this information. Offerors should include the formulas and factors used in calculating the financial data. Although submission of a compatible software or device will expedite review, failure to submit a disk will not affect consideration of the proposal.</p>

<p>(1) General—Submit cost or pricing information prepared in accordance with FAR Table 15–2, Instructions for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Cost or Pricing Information Are Required and the following:</p>

<p>(i) Clearly identify separate cost or pricing information associated with any:</p>

<p>(A) Options to extend the term of the contract;</p>

<p>(B) Options for the Government to order incremental quantities; and/or</p>

<p>(C) Major tasks, if required by the special instructions.</p>

<p>(ii) If the contract schedule includes a “Fixed Rate for Services” clause, please provide in the cost proposal a schedule duplicating the format in the clause and include proposed fixed hourly rates per labor category for the base and any optional contract periods.</p>

<p>(iii) If the contract includes the clause at EPAAR 1552.232–73 “Payments—Fixed-Rate Services Contract,” or the clause at FAR 52.232–7, “Payments Under Time and Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts,” include in the cost proposal the estimated costs and burden rate to be applied to materials, other direct costs, or subcontracts. The Government will include these costs as part of its cost proposal evaluation.</p>

<p>(iv) If other divisions, subsidiaries, a parent or affiliated companies will perform work, provide the name and location of such affiliate and offeror's intercompany pricing policy. Separately identify costs and supporting data for each entity proposed.</p>

<p>(v) The realism of costs, including personnel compensation rates (including effective hourly rates due to uncompensated overtime) will be part of the proposal evaluation. Any reductions to proposed costs or differences between proposed and known EPA/DCAA recommended rates must be fully explained. If an offeror makes a reduction which makes its offer or portions of its offer below anticipated costs, the offeror shall identify where (i.e., which elements of costs) the proposed reductions will be made. Unsubstantiated rates may result in an upward or downward adjustment of the cost proposals to reflect more realistic costs. Based on this analysis, a projected cost for the offeror will be calculated to reflect the Government's estimate of the offeror's probable costs. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between the promised performance and cost or price should be explained. The burden of proof for cost credibility rests with the offeror.</p>

<p>(2) Direct Labor. (i) The direct technical labor hours (level-of-effort) appearing in the solicitation are for professional and technical labor only. These hours do not include management at a level higher than project management, e.g., corporate and day-to-day management, nor do they include clerical and support staff at a level lower than technician. If it is the offeror's normal practice to charge these types of costs as direct costs, include these costs along with an estimate of the directly chargeable labor-hours for these personnel. These direct charges are to be shown separately from the technical (level-of-effort) effort. If this type of effort is normally included in the offeror's indirect cost allocations, no estimate is required. However, direct charging of these on any resulting contract will not be allowed. Additionally the direct technical labor hours are the workable hours required by the Government and do not include release time (i.e., holidays, vacation, etc.) Submit the proposal utilizing the labor categories and distribution of the level-of-effort specified in the solicitation. These are approximate distribution levels and do not necessarily represent the actual levels which may be experienced during contract performance.</p>

<p>(ii) Explain the basis of the proposed labor rates, including a complete justification for all judgmental factors used to develop weights applied to company's category or individual rates that comprise the rates for labor categories specified in the solicitation. This explanation should describe how technical approach coincides with the proposed costs. If the proposed direct labor rates are based on an average of the individuals proposed to work on the contract, provide a list of the individuals proposed and the hours associated with each individual in deriving the rates. If the proposed direct labor rates are based on an average of company category rates, identify and describe the labor categories and the percentages associated with each category in deriving the rates, explaining in detail the basis for the percentages assigned.</p>

<p>(iii) Describe for each labor category proposed, the company's qualifications and experience requirements. If individual rates are used, provide the employee's name. If specific individuals are identified in the technical proposal, correlate these individuals with the labor categories specified in the solicitation.</p>

<p>(iv) Provide a matrix summarizing the effort proposed, including the subcontracts, by professional and technical level specified in the solicitation.</p>

<p>(v) Indicate whether current rates or escalated rates are used. If escalation is included, state the degree (percent) and methodology. The methodology shall include the effective date of the base rates and the policy on salary reviews (e.g. anniversary date of employee or salary reviews for all employees on a specific date).</p>

<p>(vi) State whether any additional direct labor (new hire or temporary hires) will be required during the performance period of this acquisition. If so, state the number required, the professional or technical level and the methodology used to estimate proposed labor rates.</p>

<p>(vii) With respect to educational institutions, include the following information for those professional staff members whose salary is expected to be covered by a stipulated salary support agreement pursuant to OMB Circular A–21.</p>

<p>(A) Individual's name;</p>

<p>(B) Annual salary and the period for which the salary is applicable;</p>

<p>(C) List of other research Projects or proposals for which salaries are allocated, and the proportionate time charged to each; and</p>

<p>(D) Other duties, such as teaching assignments, administrative assignments, and other institutional activities. Show the proportionate time charged to each. (Show proportionate time charges as a percentage of 100% of time for the entire academic year, exclusive of vacation or sabbatical leave.)</p>

<p>(viii) Uncompensated overtime. The decision to propose uncompensated overtime is the offeror's decision. Should the offeror, however, elect to propose uncompensated overtime, the offeror must propose a methodology that is consistent with their cost accounting practices and company policy. If proposed, provide an estimate of any uncompensated overtime proposed for exempt personnel working at the offeror's facilities. This estimate should identify the number of uncompensated labor hours and the percentage of compensated labor. Uncompensated labor hours are defined as hours for exempt personnel in excess of regular hours for a pay period which are actually worked and recorded in accordance with company policy. Provide a copy of the company policy on uncompensated overtime. Provide historical percentages of uncompensated overtime for the past three years. If proposed for subcontractors, provide separately with subcontractor information.</p>

<p>(ix) For labor rate contracts, for each fixed labor rate, offerors shall identify the basis for the loaded fixed hourly rate for each contract period for example, the rate might consist of the following cost elements: raw wage or salary rate, plus fringe benefits (if applicable), plus overhead rate (if applicable), plus G&amp;A expense rate (if applicable), plus profit.</p>

<p>When determining the composite raw wage for a labor category, the offeror shall:</p>

<p>(A) provide in narrative form the basis for the raw wage for each labor category. If actual wages of current employees are used, the basis for the projections should be explained.</p>

<p>(B) If employees are subject to the Service Contract Act or Davis Bacon Act, they must be compensated at least at the minimum wage rate required by the applicable Wage Determination.</p>

<p>(3) Indirect costs (fringe, overhead, general, and administrative expenses). (i) If the rates have been recently approved, include a copy of the rate agreement. If the agreement does not cover the projected performance period of the proposed effort, provide the rationale and any estimated rate calculations for the proposed performance period.</p>

<p>(ii) Submit supporting documentation for rates which have not been approved or audited. Indicate whether computations are based upon historical or projected data.</p>

<p>(iii) Provide actual pool expenses, base dollars, or hours (as applicable for the past five years). Include the actual indirect rates for the past five years including the indirect rates proposed, the actual indirect rates experienced and, if available, the final negotiated rate. Indicate the amount of unallowable costs included in the historical data.</p>

<p>(iv) Offerors who propose indirect rates for new or substantially reorganized cost centers should consider offering to accept ceilings on the indirect rates at the proposed rates. Similarly, offerors whose subcontractors propose indirect rates for new or substantially reorganized cost centers should likewise consider offering to accept ceilings on the subcontractors' indirect rates at the proposed rates. </p>

<p>Note to paragraph (b)(3)(iv). The Government reserves the right to adjust an offeror's or its subcontractor's estimated indirect costs for evaluation purposes based on the Agency's judgment of the most probable costs up to the amount of any stated ceiling.</p>

<p>(v) If the employees are subject to the Service Contract Act or Davis Bacon Act, employees must receive the minimum level of benefits stated in the applicable Wage Determination.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Travel expense. </i>(i) If the solicitation specifies the amount of travel costs, this amount is exclusive of any applicable indirect costs and fee.</p>

<p>(ii) If the solicitation does not specify the amount of travel costs, attach a schedule illustrating how travel was computed. Include a breakdown indicating number of trips, number of travelers, destinations from and to, purpose and cost, e.g., mileage, transportation costs, subsistence rates.</p>

<p>(5) Equipment, facilities and special equipment, including tooling.</p>

<p>(i) If direct charges for use of existing contractor equipment are proposed, provide a description of these items, including estimated usage hours, rates, and total costs.</p>

<p>(ii) If equipment purchases are proposed, provide a description of these items, and a justification as to why the Government should furnish the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds. (Unless specified elsewhere in this solicitation, FAR 45.302–1 requires contractors to furnish all facilities in performance of contracts with certain limited exceptions.)</p>

<p>(iii) Identify Government-owned property in the possession of the offeror or proposed to be used in the performance of the contract, and the Government agency which has cognizance over the property.</p>

<p>(iv) Submit proposed rates or use charges for equipment, along with documentation to support those rates.</p>

<p>(v) If special purposes facilities or equipment are being proposed, provide a description of these items, details for the proposed costs including competitive prices, and justification as to why the Government should furnish the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds.</p>

<p>(vi) If fabrication by the prime contractor is contemplated, include details of material, labor, and overhead.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Other Direct Costs (ODC). </i>(i) If the solicitation specifies the amount of other direct costs, this amount is exclusive of any applicable indirect cost and fee.</p>

<p>(ii) If the amount is not specified in the solicitation, attach a schedule detailing how other direct costs were computed. Identify the major ODC items that under the accounting system would be a direct charge on any resulting contract.</p>

<p>(iii) If any of the cost elements identified as part of the specified other direct costs are recovered as an indirect cost, in accordance with the offeror's accounting system, those costs should not be included as a direct cost. Complete explanation of this adjustment and the contractor's practice should be provided.</p>

<p>(iv) Provide historical other direct costs dollars per level of effort hour on similar contracts or work assignments.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Team Subcontracts</i>. When the cost of a subcontract is substantial (5 percent of the total estimated contract dollar value or $100,000, whichever is less), the offeror shall include the following subcontractor information:</p>

<p>(i) Provide details of subcontract costs in the same format as the prime contractor's costs. This detailed information may be provided separately to the EPA if the subcontractor does not wish to provide this data to the prime contractor. Cost data provided separately by a contractor must be received by the time, date and at the location specified for the receipt of proposals. The subcontractor's package should be clearly marked with the RFP number, the name of the prime offeror, and a statement that the package is subcontractor data relevant to the proposal from the prime offeror. If submitted with the prime contractor's proposal, identify the subcontractors. State the amount of service estimated to be required and the quoted daily or hourly rate. Offerors are encouraged to provide letters of intent, signed by subcontractors, agreeing to a specified rate for life of the contract. Include a cost or price analysis of the subcontractor cost showing the reasons why the costs are considered reasonable;</p>

<p>(ii) Describe how the prospective team subcontractors were chosen as part of the offeror's proposed team; and rationale for selection;</p>

<p>(iii) Describe the necessity for the subcontractor's effort as either a supplement or complement to the offeror's in-house expertise;</p>

<p>(iv) Identify the areas of the scope of work and the level of effort the subcontractors are anticipated to perform. Provide a reconciliation summary of the proposed hours and ODCs for the prime contractor and proposed subcontractor(s).</p>

<p>(v) Describe the prime contractor's management structure and internal controls to ensure efficient and quality performance of team subcontractors.</p>

<p>(8) Facilities Capital Cost of Money (FCCM). When an offeror elects to claim FCCM as an allowable cost, the offeror must submit Form CASB-CNF and show calculation of the proposed amount. FCCM will be an allowable cost under the contemplated contract, if the criteria for allowability at FAR 31.205–10(a)(2) are met.</p>

<p><i>Alterate I</i> (AUG 1999). If the Government's requirement is a fully dedicated staff person for a twelve month period(s) for each specified position and performance is on a Government facility, add the following paragraph (b)(2)(x) to the basic provision:</p>

<p>(x) The level of effort for each position is to be proposed in work years. A work year is considered to consist of 2080 hours inclusive of direct and indirect time (40 hours per week × 52 weeks per year = 2080 hours). The proposal must identify proposed work years and clearly identify how many hours in each work year are direct (i.e., productive working hours) and how many are indirect (i.e., paid absences). If the company policy includes a different base work week, the total available hours would be different. For example, if the company's policy calls for a 37.5 hour work week, offeror would deduct paid absences from 1950 hour (37.5 hours/week × 52 weeks/year = 1950 hours). Offeror should clearly identify the paid absences as to how many hours are for holiday and how many hours are for vacation and sick leave. The amount of indirect time (paid absences) identified in the proposal must be consistent with company policy and must allow for the ten Federal government holidays.</p>

<p><i>Alternate II</i> (AUG 1999). If the Government's requirement is a fully dedicated staff person for a twelve month period(s) for each specified position and performance is not on a Government facility; add the following paragraph (b)(2)(x) to the basic provision:</p>

<p>(x) The level of effort for each position is to be proposed in work years. A work year is considered to consist of 2080 hours inclusive of direct and indirect time (40 hours per week × 52 weeks per year = 2080 hours). The proposal must identify proposed work years and clearly identify how many hours in each work year are direct (i.e., productive working hours) and how many are indirect (i.e., paid absences). If the company policy includes a different base work week, the total available hours would be different. For example, if the company's policy calls for a 37.5 hour work week, offeror would deduct paid absences from 1950 hour (37.5 hours/week × 52 weeks/year = 1950 hours). Offeror should clearly identify the paid absences as to how many hours are for holiday and how many hours are for vacation and sick leave.</p>

<p><i>Alternate III</i> (AUG 1999). If the requirement is for the acquisition of supplies or equipment, substitute the following paragraphs (a)(iv)—(viii) and add (a)(ix) and (b).</p>

<p>(iv) Provide information as to how the proposed supplies or equipment meet the salient characteristics required by the contract line item;</p>

<p>(v) Provide published brochures, catalogs, or other technical literature by contract line item;</p>

<p>(vi) Meet any interface or compatibility requirements by contract line item;</p>

<p>Advanced Understanding—Uncompensated Time (AUG 1999)</p>

<p>(a) The estimated cost of this contract is based upon the Contractor's proposal which specified that exempt personnel identified to work at the Contractor's facilities will provide uncompensated labor hours to the contract totaling ____ percent of compensated labor. (Note: the commitment for uncompensated time, and the formula elements in paragraph (b) below, apply only to exempt personnel working at the Contractor's facilities and does not include non-exempt personnel or exempt personnel working at other facilities.) Uncompensated labor hours are defined as hours of exempt personnel in excess of regular hours for a ____ pay period which are actually worked and recorded in accordance with the company policy, entitled, ________.</p>

<p>(b) Recognizing that the probable cost to the Government for the labor provided under this contract is calculated assuming a proposed level of uncompensated labor hours, it is hereby agreed that in the event the proposed level of uncompensated labor hours are not provided, an adjustment, calculated in accordance with the following formula will be made to the contract amount.</p>

<p>Formula:</p>

<p>Adjustment equals estimated value of uncompensated time hours not provided.</p>

<p>Target uncompensated time percent minus ___ percent.</p>

<p>Shortage of uncompensated time percent minus actual cost percent.</p>

<p>(c) Within three weeks after the end of the contract, the Contractor shall submit a statement concerning the amount of uncompensated time hours delivered during the contract. In the event there is a shortage of uncompensated time hours provided, a calculation, utilizing the above formula will be made and this calculation will be the basis for an adjustment in the contract amount.</p>

A score will be assigned appropriately to the offeror based on the information. The offeror will be given the opportunity to address adverse past performance information obtained from references on which the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to comment, if that information makes a difference in the Government's decision to include the offeror in or exclude the offeror from the competitive range. Any past performance deficiency or significant weakness will be discussed with offerors in the competitive range during discussions. </p>

<p>(e) Offerors must send Client Authorization Letters (see Section J of the solicitation) to each reference listed in their proposal to assist in the timely processing of the past performance evaluation. Offerors are encouraged to consolidate requests whenever possible (i.e., if the same reference has several contracts, send that reference a single notice citing all applicable contracts). Offerors may send Client Authorization Letters electronically to references with copies forwarded to the contracting officer. </p>

<p>(1) If an offeror has no relevant past performance history, an offeror must affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance history. </p>

<p>(2) Client Authorization Letters should be mailed or E-mailed to individual references no later than five (5) working days after proposal submission. The offeror should forward a copy of the Client Authorization Letter to the contracting officer simultaneously with mailing to references. </p>

<p>(f) Each offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award, other Government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications. </p>

<p>(1) Identify the segment of the company (one division or the entire company) which received the award or certification. </p>

<p>(2) Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over three years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply. </p>

<p>(g) Past performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor for award. The Past Performance Questionnaire identified in section J will be used to collect information on an offeror's performance under existing and prior contracts/subcontracts for products or services similar in scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to this requirement in order to evaluate offerors consistent with the past performance evaluation factor set forth in section M. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance. </p>

<p>(h) Any information collected concerning an offeror's past performance will be maintained in the official contract file. </p>

<p>(i) In accordance with FAR 15.305 (a) (2) (iv), offerors with no relevant past performance history, or for whom information on past performance is not available, will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably on past performance.</p>

<p>(a) General. This contract may be extended as set forth in paragraph (b) based on overall contractor performance as evaluated in accordance with the Clause entitled ``Award Term Incentive Plan,'' provided the Agency has a need for the effort at or before the time an award term is to commence, and if the contractor receives notice of the availability of funding for an award term period pursuant to the ``Award Term Availability of Funds'' clause. The Contracting Officer is responsible for the overall award term evaluation and award term decision. The Contracting Officer will unilaterally decide whether or not the contractor is eligible for an award term extension, and in conjunction with the Contracting Officer's Representative, will determine the need for continued performance and funding availability.</p>

<p>(b) Period of performance. Provided the contractor has achieved the performance measures, e.g., acceptable quality levels, set forth in the clause ``Award Term Incentive Plan,'' the Contracting Officer may extend the contract by exercising -------- [insert the total award term incentive periods] additional award term incentive period(s) of -------- [insert the award term incentive period] months each.

<p>Where EPA is not the cognizant agency, the final rate proposal shall be submitted to the above-cited address, to the cognizant audit agency, and to the designated Contracting Officer of the cognizant agency. Upon establishment of the final indirect cost rates, the Contractor shall submit an executed Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data (see FAR 15.406–2) applicable to the data furnished in connection with the final rates to the cognizant audit agency. The final rates shall be contained in a written understanding between the Contractor and the appropriate Government representative.

<p>The ``EPA Contract Property Administration Requirements'' provided below apply to this contract.</p>

<p>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</p>

<p><i>Contract Property Administration Requirements</i></p>

<p>1. Purpose. This document sets forth the requirements for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contractors performing Government property management responsibilities under EPA contracts. These requirements supplement those contained in the Government Property clause(s) and Part 45 Government Property of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).</p>

<p>2. Contract Property Administration (CPAR)</p>

<p>a. EPA Delegation. EPA delegates all contract property administration to the EPA Contract Property Coordinator (CPC). The delegations apply to all EPA contracts issued with or that have the potential to receive, purchase or acquire Government Property or include the Government Property clauses. In addition to administering all contract property, the CPC provides technical expertise and assistance to the Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) relative to Government Property.</p>

<p>b. DCMA Re-delegation. The CPC may request support for contract property management oversight, including property administration and plant clearance, from the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). If DCMA agrees to provide support, DCMA will notify the contractor of the assigned property administrator (PA) and plant clearance officer (PLCO). The DCMA PA is available to the contractor for assistance in all matters of property administration. Notwithstanding the delegation, as necessary, the contractor may contact the EPA CO. In the event of a disagreement between the contractor and the DCMA PA, the contractor should seek resolution from the CO. Unless, otherwise directed in the contract, or this document, all originals of written information or reports, except direct correspondence between the contractor and the DCMA PA, relative to Government property, should be forwarded to the administrative CO assigned to this contract and the CPC.</p>

<p>c. Disagreements. Notwithstanding the delegation(s), as necessary, the contractor may contact the CO. In the event of a disagreement between the contractor and the PA or the CPC the contractor should seek resolution from the CO.</p>

<p>3. Requests for Government Property.</p>

<p>In accordance with FAR 45.102, the contractor shall furnish all property required for performing Government contracts. If a contractor believes that Government property is required for performance of the contract, the contractor shall submit a written request to the CO. At a minimum, the request shall contain the following elements:</p>

<p>a. Contract number for which the property is required.</p>

<p>b. An item(s) description, quantity and estimated cost.</p>

<p>c. Certification that no like contractor property exists which could be utilized.</p>

<p>d. A detailed description of the task-related purpose of the property.</p>

<p>e. Explanation of negative impact if property is not provided by the Government.</p>

<p>f. Lease versus purchase analysis shall be furnished with the request to acquire property on behalf of the Government, with the exception of requests for material purchases. The contractor may not proceed with acquisition of property on behalf of the Government until receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>4. Transfer of Government Property. The Contracting Officer initiates the transfer of the government property via a contract modification. The transferor (EPA or another contractor) shall provide to the transferee, the receiving contractor, the information needed to establish and maintain the property records required of FAR 52.245-1, as well as all of the applicable data elements required by Attachment 1 of this clause. The transferee, the receiving contractor, should perform a complete inventory of the property before signing the acceptance document for the property. Accountability will transfer to the receiving contractor upon receipt and acceptance of the property, in accordance with FAR 45.106.</p>

<p>5. Records of Government Property.</p>

<p>a. In accordance with FAR 52.245-1, the contractor shall create and maintain records of all Government property, regardless of value, including property provided to and in the possession of a subcontractor. Material provided by the Government or acquired by the contractor and billed as a direct charge to the contract is Government property and records must be established as such.</p>

<p>b. The Contractor shall identify all Superfund property and designate it as such both on the item and on the Government property record. If it is not practicable to tag the item, the contractor shall write the ID number on a tag, card or other entity that may be kept with the item or in a file.</p>

<p>c. Support documentation used for posting entries to the property record shall provide complete, current and auditable data. Entries shall be posted to the record in a timely manner following an action.</p>

<p>d. For Government vehicles, in addition to the data elements required by EPA, the contractor shall also comply with the General Services Administration (GSA) and Department of Energy (DOE) record and report requirements supplied with all EPA provided motor vehicles. If the above requirements were not provided with the vehicle, the contractor shall notify the designated CPC and the Fleet Manager.</p>

<p>e. When Government property is disclosed to be in the management and/or control of the contractor but not provided under any contract, the contractor shall record and report the property in accordance with FAR 52.245-1.</p>

<p>6. Inventories of Government Property. The contractor shall conduct a complete physical inventory of EPA property at least once per year. The contractor shall report the results of the inventory, including any discrepancies, to the CO. Reconciliation of discrepancies shall be completed in accordance with the schedule negotiated with the CO. See section 10 herein, Contract Closeout, for information on final inventories.</p>

<p>7. Reports of Government Property. EPA requires an annual summary report, for each contract, by contract number, of Government property in the contractor's possession. The annual summary is due as of September 30th of each year, and upon contract termination or expiration.</p>

<p>a. For each classification listed on the EPA Property Report form, with the exception of material, the contractor shall provide the total acquisition cost and total quantity. If there are zero items in a classification, or if there is an ending balance of zero, the classification must be listed with zeros in the quantity and acquisition cost columns.</p>

<p>b. For material, the contractor shall provide the total acquisition cost only.</p>

<p>c. Property classified as Plant Equipment, Superfund and Special Test Equipment must be reported on two separate lines. The first line shall include the total acquisition cost and quantity of all items or systems with a unit acquisition cost of $25,000 or more. The second line shall include the total acquisition cost and quantity of all items with a unit acquisition cost of less than $25,000.</p>

<p>d. For items comprising a system, which is defined as ``a group of interacting items functioning as a complex whole,'' the contractor may maintain the record as a system noting all components of the system under the main component or maintain individual records for each item. However, for the annual report of Government property the components must be reported as a system with one total dollar amount for the system, if that system total is $25,000 or more.</p>

<p>e. The reports are to be received at EPA by the CPC by October 5th of each year.</p>

<p>f. Distribution shall be as follows:</p>

<p>Original to: CPC</p>

<p>One copy: CO</p>

<p>g. Contractors are required to comply with GSA and DOE special reporting requirements for motor vehicles. A statement of these requirements will be provided by the EPA Facility Management and Services Division (FMSD) concurrent with receipt of each vehicle.</p>

<p>h. The contractor shall provide detailed reports on an as-needed </p>

<p>basis, as may be requested by the CO or the CPC.</p>

<p>8. Disposition of Government Property. The disposition process is composed of three distinct phases: identification, reporting, and final disposition.a. Identification. The disposition process begins with the contractor identifying Government property that is no longer required for contract performance. Effective contract property management systems provide for identification of excess as it occurs. Once Government property has been determined to be excess to the accountable contract, it must be screened against the contractor's other EPA contracts for further use. If the property may be reutilized, the contractor shall notify the CO in writing. Government property will be transferred via contract modifications to other contracts only when the COs on both the current contract and the receiving contract authorize the transfer.</p>

<p>b. Reporting.</p>

<p>(i) <i>EPA. </i>Government property shall be reported in accordance with FAR 52.245–1. The Standard Form, SF 1428, Inventory Disposal Schedule, provides the format for reporting excess Government property. Instructions for completing and when to use the form may be found at FAR 52.245–1(j). Forward the completed SF 1428 to the CPC. The SF 1428 is available at <i>http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/FormsStandard54.html </i>. Superfund property must contain a Superfund notification and the following language must be displayed on the form: “Note to CO: Reimbursement to the EPA Superfund is required.”</p>

<p> (ii) DCMA. If the EPA contract has been re-delegated to DCMA, the excess items will be entered into the Plant Clearance Automated Reutilization Screening System (PCARSS). Access and information pertaining to this system may be addressed to the DCMA Plant Clearance Officer (PLCO).</p>

<p>c. Disposition Instructions.</p>

<p>(i) Retention. When Government property is identified as excess, the CO may direct the contractor in writing to retain all or part of the excess Government Property under the current contract for possible future requirements.</p>

<p>(ii) Return to EPA. When Government property is identified as excess, the CO may direct the contractor in writing to return those items to EPA inventory. The contractor shall ship/deliver the property in accordance with the instructions provided by the CO.</p>

<p>(iii) Transfer. When Government property is identified as excess, the CO may direct the contractor in writing to transfer the property to another EPA contractor. The contractor shall transfer the property by shipping it in accordance with the instructions provided by the CO. To effect transfer of accountability, the contractor shall provide the recipient of the property with the applicable data elements set forth in Attachment 1 of this clause.</p>

<p>(iv) Sale. If GSA or the DCMA PLCO conducts a sale of the excess Government property, the contractor shall allow prospective bidders access to property offered for sale.</p>

<p>(v) Abandonment. Abandoned property must be disposed of in a manner that does not endanger the health and safety of the public. If the contract is delegated to DCMA and the contractor has input EPA property into the PCARSS system, the EPA Property Utilization Officer (PUO) shall notify the CO. The CO shall notify the contractor in writing of those items EPA would like to retain, have returned or transferred to another EPA contractor. The contractor shall notify the DCMA PLCO and request withdrawal of those items from the inventory schedule. The contractor shall update the Government property record to indicate the disposition of the item and to close the record. The contractor shall also obtain either a signed receipt or proof of shipment from the recipient. The contractor shall notify the CO when all actions pertaining to disposition have been completed. The contractor shall complete an EPA Property report with changes, to include supporting documentation of completed disposition actions and submit it to the CPC.</p>

<p>9. Decontamination. In addition to the requirements of the ``Government Property'' clause and prior to performing disposition of any EPA Government Property, the contractor shall certify in writing that the property is free from contamination by any hazardous or toxic substances.</p>

<p>10. Contract Closeout. The contractor shall complete a physical inventory of all Government property at contract completion and the results, including any discrepancies, shall be reported to the CO. If the contract is delegated to DCMA, the physical inventory report will be submitted to the EPA CO and a copy submitted to the DCMA PA. In the case of a terminated contract, the contractor shall comply with the inventory requirements set forth in the applicable termination clause. The results of the inventory, as well as a detailed inventory listing, must be forwarded to the CO and if delegated, a copy to the DCMA PA. In order to expedite the disposal process, contractors may be required to, or may elect to submit to the CPC, an inventory schedule for disposal purposes up to six (6) months prior to contract completion. If such an inventory schedule is prepared, the contractor must indicate the earliest date that each item may be disposed. The contractor shall update all property records to show disposal action. The contractor shall notify the CO, and, if delegated, the DCMA PA, in writing, when all work has been completed under the contract and all Government property accountable to the contract has been disposed. The contractor shall complete a FINAL EPA Property report with all supporting documentation to the CPC.</p>
