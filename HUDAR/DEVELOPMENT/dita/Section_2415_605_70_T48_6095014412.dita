         <p xtrc="P">FAR subpart 15.6 outlines the policies and procedures relating to unsolicited proposals. In addition to these requirements, the Department requires that each award made as the result of an unsolicited proposal for research contain a commitment to provide actual cost-sharing. This provision will be included in the award whether or not cost-sharing was part of the unsolicited proposal.
