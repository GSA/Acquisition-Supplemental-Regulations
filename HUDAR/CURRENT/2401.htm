<p align="center"><a name="P0_0"></a><b>PART 2401--FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SYSTEM</b></p>

<p><a name="P1_48"></a><b>2401.000 Scope of Part. .</b> </p>

<p>This part describes the method by which the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) implements, supplements and deviates from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) through the establishment of the HUD Acquisition Regulation (HUDAR), which prescribes the Department's procurement policies and procedures under the FAR System. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="P3_412"></a><b>Subpart 2401.1--Purpose, Authority, Issuance</b></p>

<p><a name="P4_456"></a><b>2401.100 Scope of subpart..</b> </p>

<p>This subpart describes the HUDAR and states its relationship to the FAR System. This subpart also provides the explanation of the purpose and the authorities under which the HUDAR is issued. </p>

<p><a name="P6_675"></a><b>2401.101 Purpose.</b> </p>

<p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development Acquisition Regulation is hereby established as Chapter 24 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation System (48 CFR Chapter 24). It is issued to provide uniform Departmental policies and procedures for the acquisition of supplies, personal property and non-personal services by the Department's contracting activities and to make these policies and procedures readily available to Departmental personnel and to the public. </p>

<p><a name="P8_1160"></a><b>2401.103 Authority..</b> </p>

<p>The HUDAR is prescribed under section 7(d) of the Department of HUD Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)), section 205(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 486(c)), the general authorization in <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#b1301. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.htm#P893_29218"><u>FAR 1.301</u></a></font>, and the Secretary's delegations of procurement authority. </p>

<p><a name="P10_1471"></a><b>2401.104 Applicability. .</b> </p>

<p>All acquisition of personal property and non-personal services (including construction) by HUD, except as may be otherwise authorized by law, must be accomplished in accordance with the HUDAR and the FAR.</p>

<p><a name="P12_1701"></a><b>2401.105 Issuance.</b> </p>

<p><a name="P13_1720"></a><b>2401.105-2 Arrangement of regulations. </b></p>

<p>(a) <i>General</i>. Chapter 24 is divided into parts, subparts, sections, subsections, paragraphs and further subdivisions as necessary. </p>

<p>(b) <i>Numbering</i>. Generally, the numbering system and part, subpart, and section titles used in the HUDAR conform with those used in the FAR or as follows: </p>

<p>(1) When the HUDAR implements or deviates from a parallel part, subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph of the FAR, that implementation or deviation will be numbered and captioned where possible to correspond to the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph. For example, FAR Subpart 1.4, Deviations, is implemented in HUD's acquisition regulations at Subpart 2401.4, Deviations. (The &quot;24&quot; in the number indicates what chapter of Title 48 contains the HUDAR.) </p>

<p>(2) When HUD supplements material contained in the FAR, it is given a unique number containing the numerals &quot;70&quot; or higher. The rest of the number will parallel the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection or paragraph it is supplementing. For example, FAR 14.407, Award, does not contain a provision for the steps to be taken when only one bid is received. The HUDAR provides this information. Since the subject matter supplements what is contained in FAR 14.407, the HUDAR section supplementing the FAR is numbered 2414.407-70. </p>

<p>(3) Where material in the FAR requires no implementation or deviation, there is no corresponding numbering in the HUDAR. Therefore, there may be gaps in the HUDAR sequence of numbers where the FAR, as written, is applicable to the HUDAR and requires no further implementation. </p>

<p>(c) <i>Citation</i>. The HUDAR will be cited in accordance with Federal Register standards approved for the FAR. Thus, this section when referred to in the HUDAR is cited as 2401.105-2(c). When this section is referred to formally in official documents, such as legal briefs, it should be cited as &quot;48 CFR 2401.105-2(c).&quot; Any section of the HUDAR may be formally identified by the section number, e.g., &quot;HUDAR 2401.105-2.&quot; In the HUDAR, any reference to the FAR will be indicated by &quot;FAR&quot; followed by the section number, for example FAR 37.108. </p>

<p><a name="P20_3859"></a><b>2401.106 OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.</b> </p>

<p>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) requires that Federal agencies obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before collecting information from 10 or more persons. HUD has received approval from OMB to collect information under the provisions of its Acquisition Regulation. The OMB Approval Number is 2535-0091. </p>

<p><a name="P22_4271"></a><b>2401.106-70 Contract clause.</b></p>

<p>The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 2452.201-70, Coordination of Data Collection Activities, in solicitations and contracts where the Contractor is required to collect information from ten or more public respondents.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="P24_4530"></a><b>Subpart 2401.3--Agency Acquisition Regulations</b></p>

<p><a name="P25_4576"></a><b>2401.301 Policy.</b> </p>

<p>(a)(1) <i>Implementation</i>. The HUDAR implements and supplements the FAR. Implementation material is that which expands upon related FAR material. Supplementing material is that for which there is no counterpart in the FAR. </p>

<p><a name="P27_4812"></a><b>2401.302 Limitations.</b> </p>

<p>(c) <i>Exclusions</i>. Certain HUD policies and procedures which come within the scope of this chapter are not included in the HUDAR. Not included is a policy or procedure of an internal nature or which is expected to be effective for a period of less than six months. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="P29_5096"></a><b>Subpart 2401.4--Deviations from the FAR</b></p>
