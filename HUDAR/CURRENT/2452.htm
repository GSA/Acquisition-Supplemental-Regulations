Contract records may be located or stored on the contractor's premises or at off-site locations.</p>

<p>Electronically stored information (ESI) means any contract records that are stored on, or generated by, an electronic device, or contained in electronically accessible media, either owned by the contractor, subcontractor(s), or employees of the contractor or subcontractor(s) regardless of the physical location of the device or media ( e.g., offsite servers or data storage).</p>

Upon receipt of the hold notice, the Contractor shall immediately take the following actions—</p>

<p>(1) Discontinue any alteration, overwriting, deletion, or destruction of all tangible materials and ESI.</p>

<p>(2) Preserve tangible materials and ESI. The contractor shall preserve ESI in its “native” form to preserve metadata ( i.e., creation and modification history of a document).</p>

<p>(3) Identify all individuals who possess or may possess tangible materials and ESI related to this matter, including contractor employees, subcontractors, and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall provide the names of all such individuals via email to the HUD official indicated in the notice.</p>

The contractor shall immediately confirm receipt of such request. The contractor shall describe in detail any records that the contractor knows or believes to be unavailable and provide a detailed explanation of why they are unavailable, and if known, their location.</p>

<p>(c)(1) If any request for records pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this clause causes an increase in the estimated cost or price or the time required for performance of any part of the work under this contract, or otherwise affects any other terms and conditions of this contract, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within __ [ Contracting Officer insert period; 30 days if no other period inserted ] from the date of receipt of the Contracting Officer's request made pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this clause. However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a request submitted before final payment of the contract.</p>

<p>(3) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the “Disputes” clause of this contract. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the contractor from providing the records requested by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(e) The Contractor shall include this clause in all subcontracts.</p>

<p align="center">(End of clause)</p>

<p>Alternate I (DEC 2012) For cost-reimbursement type contracts, substitute the following paragraph (c)(1) for paragraph (c)(1) of the basic clause:</p>

The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on the incrementally funded line item(s) beyond that point.

This notification will state: the estimated date when that point will be reached; and an estimate of the amount of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of the applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (a) of this clause (or to another mutually agreed-upon date).

<p align="center">ACCESS TO HUD FACILITIES (DEC 2012)</p>

<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause—</p>

<p>Access means physical entry into and, to the extent authorized, mobility within a Government facility.</p>

<p>Contractor employee means an employee of the prime contractor or of any subcontractor, affiliate, partner, joint venture, or team members with which the contractor is associated. It also includes consultants engaged by any of those entities.</p>

<p>Facility and Government facility mean buildings, including areas within buildings that are owned, leased, shared, occupied, or otherwise controlled by the Federal Government.</p>

<p>NACI means National Agency Check with Inquiries, the minimum background investigation prescribed by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</p>

<p>PIV Card means the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card, the Federal Government-issued identification credential (identification badge).</p>

<p>(b) General. The performance of this contract requires contractor employees to have access to HUD facilities. All such employees who do not already possess a current PIV Card acceptable to HUD shall be required to provide personal background information, undergo a background investigation (NACI or other OPM-required or approved investigation), including an FBI National Criminal History Fingerprint Check, and obtain a PIV Card prior to being permitted access to any such facility in performance of this contract. HUD may accept a PIV Card issued by another Federal Government agency but shall not be required to do so. No contractor employee will be permitted access to a HUD facility without a proper PIV Card.</p>

<p>(c) Background information. (1) For each contractor employee subject to the requirements of this clause and not in possession of a current PIV Card acceptable to HUD, the contractor shall submit the following properly completed forms: Standard Form (SF) 85, “Questionnaire for Non-sensitive Positions,” FD 258 (Fingerprint Chart), and a partial Optional Form (OF) 306 (Items 1, 2, 6, 8-13, 16, and 17). The SF-85 and OF-306 are available from the OPM Web site, http://www.opm.gov. The GTR will provide all other forms that are not obtainable via the Internet.</p>

<p>(2) The contractor shall deliver the forms and information required in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause to the GTR.</p>

<p>(3) The information provided in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this clause will be used to perform a background investigation to determine the suitability of the contractor employees to have access to Government facilities. After completion of the investigation, the GTR will notify the contractor in writing when any contractor employee is determined to be unsuitable for access to a Government facility. The contractor shall immediately remove such employee(s) from work on this contract that requires physical presence in a Government facility.</p>

<p>(4) Affected contractor employees who have had a federal background investigation without a subsequent break in federal employment or federal contract service exceeding 2 years may be exempt from the investigation requirements of this clause subject to verification of the previous investigation. For each such employee, the contractor shall submit the following information in lieu of the forms and information listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause: Employee's full name, Social Security Number, and place and date of birth.</p>

<p>(d) PIV Cards. (1) HUD will issue a PIV Card to each contractor employee who is to be given access to HUD facilities and who does not already possess a PIV Card acceptable to HUD (see paragraph (b) of this clause). HUD will not issue the PIV Card until the contractor employee has successfully cleared the FBI National Criminal History Fingerprint Check and HUD has initiated the background investigation for the contractor employee. Initiation is defined to mean that all background information required in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause has been delivered to HUD. The employee may not be given access prior to those two events. HUD may issue a PIV Card and grant access pending the completion of the background investigation. HUD will revoke the PIV Card and the employee's access if the background investigation process (including adjudication of investigation results) for the employee has not been completed within 6 months after the issuance of the PIV Card.</p>

<p>(2) PIV Cards shall identify individuals as contractor employees. Contractor employees shall display their PIV Cards on their persons at all times while working in a HUD facility, and shall present cards for inspection upon request by HUD officials or HUD security personnel.</p>

<p>(3) The contractor shall be responsible for all PIV Cards issued to the contractor's employees and shall immediately notify the GTR if any PIV Card(s) cannot be accounted for. The contractor shall promptly return PIV Cards to HUD as required by the FAR clause at 52.204-9. The contractor shall notify the GTR immediately whenever any contractor employee no longer has a need for his/her HUD-issued PIV Card (e.g., employee terminates employment with the contractor, employee's duties no longer require access to HUD facilities). The GTR will instruct the contractor as to how to return the PIV Card. Upon expiration of this contract, the GTR will instruct the contractor as to how to return all HUD-issued PIV Cards not previously returned. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, the contractor shall not return PIV Cards to any person other than the GTR.</p>

<p>(e) Control of access. HUD shall have, and exercise, complete control over granting, denying, withholding, and terminating access of contractor employees to HUD facilities. The GTR will notify the contractor immediately when HUD has determined that an employee is unsuitable or unfit to be permitted access to a HUD facility. The contractor shall immediately notify such employee that he/she no longer has access to any HUD facility, remove the employee from any such facility that he/she may be in, and provide a suitable replacement in accordance with the requirements of this clause.</p>

<p>(f) Access to HUD information systems. If this contract requires contractor employees to have access to HUD information system(s), application(s), or information contained in such systems, the contractor shall comply with all requirements of HUDAR clause 2452.239-70, Access to HUD Systems, including providing for each affected employee any additional background investigation forms prescribed in that clause.</p>
