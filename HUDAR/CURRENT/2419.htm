<p>(f) By Partnership Agreement between the SBA and HUD, the SBA delegated to HUD's Senior Procurement Executive its authority under paragraph 8(a)(1)(A) of the Small Business Act (5 U.S.C. 637(a)) to enter into 8(a) prime contracts, and its authority under 8(a)(1)(B) of the Small Business Act to award the performance of those contracts to eligible 8(a) Program participants. Under the Partnership Agreement, a contract may be awarded directly to an 8(a) firm on either a sole-source or competitive basis. The SBA reserves the right to withdraw the delegation issued as a result of the Partnership Agreement; however, any such withdrawal shall have no effect on contracts already awarded under the Partnership Agreement.</p>

The following apply to such acquisitions:</p>

<p>(1) Neither offering letters to, nor acceptance letters from the SBA are required.</p>

<p>(2) The contracting officer will use the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database on the Internet ( http://www.ccr.gov ) to establish that the selected 8(a) firm is a current program participant.</p>

<p>(b) Once an 8(a) contractor has been identified, the contracting officer will establish the price with the selected 8(a) contractor.</p>

<p>(c) For acquisitions requiring an award document (e.g., purchase order), the contracting officer will:</p>

<p>(1) Prepare and issue an award document in accordance with the applicable provisions of FAR part 13 and HUDAR part <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .2413.doc. --><a href="2413.htm#TopOfPage"><u>2413</u></a></font>.

<p>(b) If the acquisition is conducted under the Partnership Agreement cited in <font color="#0000ff"><a href="2419.htm#P21_3532"><u>2419.800</u></a></font>, HUD is delegated the authority to negotiate directly with the 8(a) participant; however, if requested by the 8(a) participant, the SBA may participate in negotiations.</p>

<p>(4) A single award document shall be used between HUD and the 8(a) contractor.
