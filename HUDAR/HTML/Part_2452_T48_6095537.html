The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on the incrementally funded line item(s) beyond that point. The Government will in no event be obligated to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for the incrementally funded line item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled “<em class="ph i">Termination for Convenience of the Government.</em>” As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination for convenience of applicable line item(s) includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those line item(s).

This notification will state: the estimated date when that point will be reached; and an estimate of the amount of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of the applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (a) of this clause (or to another mutually agreed-upon date). The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the line item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (a) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed-upon date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any line item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “<em class="ph i">Termination for Convenience of the Government.</em>”

Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder shall be considered a dispute subject to the “<em class="ph i">Disputes</em>” clause in this contract.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(7) The Contractor shall notify the COR in writing whenever a contractor employee for whom a background investigation package was required and submitted to HUD, or for whom a background investigation was completed, terminates employment with the Contractor, or otherwise is no longer performing work under this contract that requires access to the system(s), application(s), or information.

         <p class="p List2">(1)

The COR will instruct the Contractor as to how to return the PIV Card. Upon expiration of this contract, the COR will instruct the Contractor as to how to return all HUD-issued PIV Cards not previously returned. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not return PIV Cards to any person other than the COR.
