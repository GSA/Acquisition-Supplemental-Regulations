         <p xtrc="P">The Department has promoted energy efficient products as well as products with recycled or biobased content as these products have become more common and the market has become more energy and resource aware. All of these products and services and others with environmentally preferable attributes are captured in the DOE Sustainable Acquisition Program. Guidance on all these products may be found at: <i>http://www.hss.energy.gov/pp/epp/.</i>
