      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) When a management and operating contract is to be awarded on a cost-plus-award-fee basis, several special considerations are appropriate. 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) All annual performance incentives identified under these contracts are funded from the annual total available fee, which consists of a base fee amount (which may be zero) and a performance fee amount (which typically will consist of an incentive fee component for objective performance requirements, an award fee component for subjective performance requirements, or both). 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(c) The annual total available fee for the contract shall equal the product of the fee(s) that would have been calculated for an annual fixed fee contract and the classification factor(s) most appropriate for the facility/task. If more than one fee schedule is applicable to the contract, the annual total available fee shall be the sum of the available fees derived proportionately from each fee schedule; consideration of significant factors applicable to each fee schedule; and application of a Classification Factor(s) most appropriate for the work. 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(d) Classification Factors applied to each Facility/Task Category are:
