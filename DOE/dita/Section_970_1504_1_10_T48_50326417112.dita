      <conbody>
         <p xtrc="P">In situations where the objective performance incentives are of unusual difficulty or where the successful completion of the performance incentives would provide extraordinary value to the Government, fees in excess of those allowed under 970.1504-1-5 and 970.1504-1-9 may be allowed with the approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. Requests to allow fees in excess of those provided under other provisions of this fee policy must be accompanied by a written justification with detailed supporting rationale as to how the specific circumstances satisfy the two criteria listed in this subsection.
