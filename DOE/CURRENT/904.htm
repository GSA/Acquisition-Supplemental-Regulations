<p><i>Access authorization</i> means an administrative determination that an individual is eligible for access to classified information or is eligible for access to, or control over, special nuclear material. </p>

<p><i>Applicant</i> means an individual who has submitted an expression of interest in employment; who is under consideration by the contractor for employment in a particular position; and who has not removed himself or herself from further consideration or otherwise indicated that he or she is no longer interested in the position.</p>

<p><i>Classified information</i> means information that is classified as restricted data or formerly restricted data under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, or information determined to require protection against unauthorized disclosure under Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, as amended, or prior executive orders, which is identified as national security information.</p>

<p><i>Facility clearance</i> means an administrative determination that a facility is eligible to access, produce, use or store classified information, or special nuclear material. </p>

<p><i>Restricted data</i> means all data concerning design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; production of special nuclear material; or use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, but excluding data declassified or removed from the restricted data category pursuant to Section 142, as amended, of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2162).</p>

<p><i>Review or background review</i> means a Contractor's assessment of the background of an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee for a position requiring a DOE access authorization prior to selecting that individual for such a position.</p>

<p>[67 FR 14875, Mar. 28, 2002, as amended at 74 FR 23124, May 18, 2009]</p>

<p><a name="P12_1991"></a><b>904.402   General.</b></p>

<p>(a) The basis of Department of Energy's (DOE) industrial security requirements is the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and Executive Orders 12958 and 12829. </p>

<p>(b) DOE security regulations concerning restricted data are codified at 10 CFR part 1045.</p>

<p>(c)(1) Section 234B of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2282b) requires that DOE contracts include a clause that provides for an appropriate reduction in the fees or amounts paid to the contractor under the contract in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any rule, regulation, or order relating to the safeguarding or security of Restricted Data or other classified information. The clause is required for all DOE prime contracts that involve any possibility of contractor access to Restricted Data or other classified information. The clause is required to specify various degrees of violations and the amount of the reduction attributable to each degree of violation. The clause prescribed at 904.404(d)(6) (952.204-76, Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information) or the clause prescribed at 923.7003(f) (952.223-76, Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health) shall be used for this purpose unless the clause prescribed at 970.1504-5(b)(1) (970.5215-3, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts) is used.</p>

<p>(2) The 952.204-76 clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information” and the 952.223-76 clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health” provide for reductions of fee or profit that is earned by the contractor depending upon the severity of the contractor's failure to comply with contract terms or conditions relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information. When reviewing performance failures that would otherwise warrant a reduction of earned fee, the contracting officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range specified in the clause. Some of the mitigating factors that must be considered are specified in the clause. </p>

<p>(3) The contracting officer must obtain the concurrence of the Head of the Contracting Activity— </p>

<p>(i) Prior to effecting any reduction of fee or amounts otherwise payable to the contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 952.204-76 clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information” or of the 952.223-76 clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health;” and </p>

<p>(ii) For determinations that no reduction of fee is warranted for a particular performance failure(s) that would otherwise warrant a reduction.</p>

<p>[67 FR 14876, Mar. 28, 2002, as amended at 68 FR 68776, Dec. 10, 2003; 74 FR 36361, July 22, 2009]</p>

<p><a name="P21_5214"></a><b>904.404   Solicitation provision and contract clause.</b></p>

<p>(d) The security clauses to be used in DOE contracts are found at 952.204. They are:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Security, 952.204-2.</i> This clause is required in contracts and subcontracts, the performance of which involves or is likely to involve classified information, access to special nuclear materials or the provision of protective services. DOE utilizes the National Industrial Security Program but DOE's security authority is derived from the Atomic Energy Act which contains specific language not found in other agencies' authorities. For this reason, DOE contracts must contain the clause at 952.204-2 rather than the clause at 48 CFR 52.204-2. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Classification/Declassification, 952.204-70.</i> This clause is to be used in all contracts which involve classified information.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Sensitive foreign nation controls, 952.204-71.</i> This clause is required in unclassified research contracts which may involve making unclassified information about nuclear technology available to certain sensitive foreign nations. The contractor shall be provided at the time of award the listing of nations referenced in DOE Order 142.3 or its successor. (The attachment referred to in the clause shall set forth the applicable requirements of the DOE regulations on dissemination of unclassified published and unpublished technical information to foreign nations.)</p>

<p>(4) <i>Disclosure of information, 952.204-72.</i> This clause may be used in place of the clauses entitled “Security” and “Classification” in contracts with educational institutions for research work performed in their own institute facilities that are not likely to produce classified information.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Facility Clearance, 952.204-73.</i> This solicitation provision should be used in solicitations expected to result in contracts and subcontracts that require employees to possess access authorizations.</p>

<p>(6) Except as prescribed in 970.1504-5(b), the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.204-76, Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health, in all contracts that contain the clause at 952.204-2, Security, but that do not contain the clause at 952.250-70, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Computer Security, 952.204-77.</i> This clause is required in contracts in which the contractor may have access to computers owned, leased or operated on behalf of the Department of Energy.</p>

<p><a name="P41_9072"></a><b>904.804-1   Closeout by the office administering the contract.</b></p>

<p>(a) The Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) shall ensure that necessary procedures and milestone schedules are established to meet the requirements of 48 CFR 4.804-1, and that resources are applied to effect the earliest practicable deobligation of excess funds and the timely closeout of all contract files which are physically completed or otherwise eligible for closeout action.</p>

<p>(b) Quick closeout procedures for cost reimbursable and other than firm fixed price type contracts are covered under 48 CFR 42.708.</p>

<p>This subpart sets forth the Department of Energy policies and procedures regarding Facility Clearances for contractors and subcontractors that require access to classified information or special nuclear material. A Facility Clearance is based upon a determination that satisfactory safeguards and security measures are carried out for classified activities being performed at the facility and upon a favorable foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) determination.</p>

<p>[67 FR 14876, Mar. 28, 2002]</p>

<p><a name="P52_10530"></a><b>904.7001   Applicability.</b></p>

<p>The provisions of this subpart shall apply to all offeror(s), contractors, and subcontractors who will or do have access to classified information or a significant quantity of special nuclear material. </p>

<p>[49 FR 11941, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9104, Feb. 25, 1994; 76 FR 7690, Feb. 11, 2011]</p>

<p><a name="P55_10853"></a><b>904.7002   Definitions.</b></p>

<p><i>Contract</i> means the prime contract and the subcontract at any tier.</p>

<p><i>Contracting officer</i> means the DOE contracting officer.</p>

<p><i>Contractor</i> means the contractor and the subcontractor at any tier.</p>

<p><i>Facility clearance</i> means an administrative determination that a facility is eligible to access, produce, use, or store classified information, or special nuclear material. </p>

<p><i>Foreign interest</i> means any of the following—</p>

<p>(1) Foreign government or foreign government agency or instrumentality thereof;</p>

<p>(2) Any form of business enterprise organized under the laws of any country other than the United States or its possessions;</p>

<p>(3) Any form of business enterprise organized or incorporated under the laws of the U.S., or a State or other jurisdiction within the U.S. which is owned, controlled, or influenced by a foreign government, agency, firm, corporation, or person; or</p>

<p>(4) Any person who is not a U.S. citizen.</p>

<p><i>Foreign ownership, control, or influence</i> means the situation where the degree of ownership, control, or influence over an offeror(s) or a contractor by a foreign interest is such that a reasonable basis exists for concluding that compromise of classified information or special nuclear material may possibly result.</p>

<p><i>Special nuclear material</i> means special nuclear material as defined in 10 CFR 710.5(a).</p>

<p>[49 FR 11941, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9104, Feb. 25, 1994; 67 FR 14876, Mar. 28, 2002; 74 FR 36361, July 22, 2009; 76 FR 7690, Feb. 11, 2011]</p>

<p><a name="P68_12323"></a><b>904.7003   Disclosure of foreign ownership, control, or influence.</b></p>

<p>(a) If a contract requires a contractor to have a Facility Clearance, DOE must determine whether the contractor is or may be subject to foreign ownership, control or influence before a contract can be awarded. </p>

<p>(b) If, during the performance of a contract, the contractor comes under FOCI, then the DOE must determine whether a continuation of the Facility Clearance may pose an undue risk to the common defense and security through the possible compromise of that information or material. If the DOE determines that such a threat or potential threat exists, the contracting officer shall consider the alternatives of negotiating an acceptable method of isolating the foreign interest which owns, controls, or influences the contractor or terminating the contract. </p>

<p>(c) It is essential for the DOE to obtain information about FOCI which is sufficient to help the Department determine whether award of a contract to a person or firm, or the continued performance of a contract by a person or firm, may pose undue risk to the common defense and security. Therefore, the provision specified at 952.204-73 Facility Clearance, shall be included in solicitations that involve offeror(s) or contractors that are subject to 904.7001.</p>

<p>(d) The contracting officer shall not award or extend any contract subject to this subpart, exercise any options under a contract, modify any contracts subject to this subpart, or approve or consent to a subcontract subject to this subpart unless—</p>

<p>(1) The contractor provides the information required by the solicitation provision at 952.204-73 Facility Clearance, and </p>

<p>(2) The contracting officer has made a positive determination in accordance with 904.7004.</p>

<p>[49 FR 11941, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9104, Feb. 25, 1994; 62 FR 42073, Aug. 5, 1997; 67 FR 14876, Mar. 28, 2002; 74 FR 36362, July 22, 2009]</p>

<p><a name="P76_14224"></a><b>904.7004   Findings, determination, and contract award or termination.</b></p>

<p>(a) Based on the information disclosed by the offeror(s) or contractor, and after consulting with the DOE Office of Safeguards and Security, the contracting officer must determine that award of a contract to an offeror(s) or continued performance of a contract by a contractor will not pose an undue risk to the common defense and security. The contracting officer need not prepare a separate finding and determination addressing FOCI; however, the memorandum of negotiation shall include a discussion of the applicability of this subpart and the resulting determination.</p>

<p>(b) In those cases where FOCI does exist, and the DOE determines that an undue risk to the common defense and security may exist, the offeror(s) or contractor shall be requested to propose within a prescribed period of time a plan of action to avoid or mitigate the foreign influences by isolation of the foreign interest.</p>

<p>(c) The types of plans that a contractor can propose are: measures which provide for physical or organizational separation of the facility or organizational component containing the classified information or special nuclear material; modification or termination of agreements with foreign interests; diversification or reduction of foreign source income; assignment of specific security duties and responsibilities to board members or special executive level committees; or any other actions to negate or reduce FOCI to acceptable levels. The plan of action may vary with the type of foreign interest involved, degree of ownership, and information involved so that each plan must be negotiated on a case by case basis. If the offeror(s) or contractor and the DOE cannot negotiate a plan of action that isolates the offeror(s) or contractor from FOCI satisfactory to the DOE, then the offeror(s) shall not be considered for contract award and affected existing contracts with a contractor shall be terminated.</p>
