<p><a name="P4_233"></a><b>952.000   Scope of part.</b></p>

<p>This part implements FAR part 52 which sets forth contract clauses for use in connection with the acquisition of personal property and nonpersonal services (including construction), and supplements, as well as modifies, FAR part 52 by prescribing certain modifications to be made to FAR clauses when used in Department of Energy (DOE) contracts and specifying certain Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation clauses to be used in addition to or in place of such FAR clauses.</p>

<p>[49 FR 12042, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 74 FR 36368, July 22, 2009]</p>

<p><a name="P7_805"></a><b>952.001   General policy.</b></p>

<p>It is DOE policy to use the prescribed FAR and DOE contract clauses wherever practicable. Uniformity in the use of contract clauses helps to ensure impartial treatment of all contractors, expedites negotiation and contract review, and facilitates contract administration.</p>

<p><a name="P15_1836"></a><b>952.203-70   Whistleblower protection for contractor employees.</b></p>

<p>As prescribed in 903.971, insert the following clause:</p>

<p><b>Whistleblower Protection for Contractor Employees (DEC 2000) </b></p>

<p>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the requirements of “DOE Contractor Employee Protection Program” at 10 CFR part 708 for work performed on behalf of DOE directly related to activities at DOE-owned or -leased sites. </p>

<p>(b) The Contractor shall insert or have inserted the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in subcontracts at all tiers, for subcontracts involving work performed on behalf of DOE directly related to activities at DOE-owned or leased sites.</p>

<p><a name="P23_2639"></a><b>952.204-2   Security.</b></p>

<p>As prescribed in 904.404(d)(1), the following clause shall be included in contracts entered into under section 31 (research assistance, 42 U.S.C. 2051), or section 41 (ownership and operation of production facilities, 42 U.S.C. 2061) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and in other contracts and subcontracts which involve or are likely to involve classified information or special nuclear material:</p>

<p><b>Security Requirements (Aug. 2016)</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Responsibility.</i> It is the Contractor's duty to protect all classified information, special nuclear material, and other DOE property. The Contractor shall, in accordance with DOE security regulations and requirements, be responsible for protecting all classified information and all classified matter (including documents, material and special nuclear material) which are in the Contractor's possession in connection with the performance of work under this contract against sabotage, espionage, loss or theft. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this contract, the Contractor shall, upon completion or termination of this contract, transmit to DOE any classified matter or special nuclear material in the possession of the Contractor or any person under the Contractor's control in connection with performance of this contract. If retention by the Contractor of any classified matter is required after the completion or termination of the contract, the Contractor shall identify the items and classification levels and categories of matter proposed for retention, the reasons for the retention, and the proposed period of retention. If the retention is approved by the Contracting Officer, the security provisions of the contract shall continue to be applicable to the classified matter retained. Special nuclear material shall not be retained after the completion or termination of the contract.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Regulations.</i> The Contractor agrees to comply with all security regulations and contract requirements of DOE as incorporated into the contract.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Definition of classified information.</i> The term <i>Classified Information</i> means information that is classified as Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, or information determined to require protection against unauthorized disclosure under Executive Order 12958, <i>Classified National Security Information,</i> as amended, or prior executive orders, which is identified as <i>National Security Information.</i></p>

<p>(d) <i>Definition of restricted data.</i> The term <i>Restricted Data</i> means all data concerning design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; production of special nuclear material; or use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, but excluding data declassified or removed from the Restricted Data category pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2162 [Section 142, as amended, of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954].</p>

<p>(e) <i>Definition of formerly restricted data.</i> The term ”<i>Formerly Restricted Data”</i> means information removed from the Restricted Data category based on a joint determination by DOE or its predecessor agencies and the Department of Defense that the information—(1) Relates primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons; and (2) can be adequately protected as National Security Information. However, such information is subject to the same restrictions on transmission to other countries or regional defense organizations that apply to Restricted Data.</p>

<p>(f) <i>Definition of national security information.</i> The term “<i>National Security Information”</i> means information that has been determined, pursuant to Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, as amended, or any predecessor order, to require protection against unauthorized disclosure, and that is marked to indicate its classified status when in documentary form.</p>

<p>(g) <i>Definition of special nuclear material.</i> The term “special nuclear material” means—(1) Plutonium, uranium enriched in the isotope 233 or in the isotope 235, and any other material which, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2071 [section 51 as amended, of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954] has been determined to be special nuclear material, but does not include source material; or (2) any material artificially enriched by any of the foregoing, but does not include source material.</p>

<p>(h) <i>Access authorizations of personnel.</i> (1) The Contractor shall not permit any individual to have access to any classified information or special nuclear material, except in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and the DOE's regulations and contract requirements applicable to the particular level and category of classified information or particular category of special nuclear material to which access is required.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor must conduct a thorough review, as defined at 48 CFR 904.401, of an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee, and must test the individual for illegal drugs, prior to selecting the individual for a position requiring a DOE access authorization.</p>

<p>(i) A review must—Verify an uncleared applicant's or uncleared employee's educational background, including any high school diploma obtained within the past five years, and degrees or diplomas granted by an institution of higher learning; contact listed employers for the last three years and listed personal references; conduct local law enforcement checks when such checks are not prohibited by state or local law or regulation and when the uncleared applicant or uncleared employee resides in the jurisdiction where the Contractor is located; and conduct a credit check and other checks as appropriate.</p>

<p>(ii) Contractor reviews are not required for an applicant for DOE access authorization who possesses a current access authorization from DOE or another Federal agency, or whose access authorization may be reapproved without a federal background investigation pursuant to Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information (August 4, 1995), Sections 3.3(c) and (d).</p>

<p>(iii) In collecting and using this information to make a determination as to whether it is appropriate to select an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee to a position requiring an access authorization, the Contractor must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders, including those—(A) Governing the processing and privacy of an individual's information, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; and (B) prohibiting discrimination in employment, such as under the ADA, Title VII and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, including with respect to pre- and post-offer of employment disability related questioning.</p>

<p>(iv) In addition to a review, each candidate for a DOE access authorization must be tested to demonstrate the absence of any illegal drug, as defined in 10 CFR 707.4. All positions requiring access authorizations are deemed <i>testing designated positions</i> in accordance with 10 CFR part 707. All employees possessing access authorizations are subject to applicant, random or for cause testing for use of illegal drugs. DOE will not process candidates for a DOE access authorization unless their tests confirm the absence from their system of any illegal drug.</p>

<p>(v) When an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee receives an offer of employment for a position that requires a DOE access authorization, the Contractor shall not place that individual in such a position prior to the individual's receipt of a DOE access authorization, unless an approval has been obtained from the head of the cognizant local security office. If the individual is hired and placed in the position prior to receiving an access authorization, the uncleared employee may not be afforded access to classified information or matter or special nuclear material (in categories requiring access authorization) until an access authorization has been granted.</p>

<p>(vi) The Contractor must maintain a record of information concerning each uncleared applicant or uncleared employee who is selected for a position requiring an access authorization. Upon request only, the following information will be furnished to the head of the cognizant local DOE Security Office:</p>

<p>(A) The date(s) each Review was conducted;</p>

<p>(B) Each entity that provided information concerning the individual;</p>

<p>(C) A certification that the review was conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders, including those governing the processing and privacy of an individual's information collected during the review;</p>

<p>(D) A certification that all information collected during the review was reviewed and evaluated in accordance with the Contractor's personnel policies; and</p>

<p>(E) The results of the test for illegal drugs.</p>

<p>(i) <i>Criminal liability.</i> It is understood that disclosure of any classified information relating to the work or services ordered hereunder to any person not entitled to receive it, or failure to protect any classified information, special nuclear material, or other Government property that may come to the Contractor or any person under the Contractor's control in connection with work under this contract, may subject the Contractor, its agents, employees, or Subcontractors to criminal liability under the laws of the United States (see the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. 2011 <i>et seq.;</i> 18 U.S.C. 793 and 794).</p>

<p>(j) <i>Foreign ownership, control, or influence.</i> (1) The Contractor shall immediately provide the cognizant security office written notice of any change in the extent and nature of foreign ownership, control or influence over the Contractor which would affect any answer to the questions presented in the Standard Form (SF) 328, <i>Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests,</i> executed prior to award of this contract. The Contractor will submit the Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) information in the format directed by DOE. When completed the Contractor must print and sign one copy of the SF 328 and submit it to the Contracting Officer. In addition, any notice of changes in ownership or control which are required to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, or the Department of Justice, shall also be furnished concurrently to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(2) If a Contractor has changes involving foreign ownership, control, or influence, DOE must determine whether the changes will pose an undue risk to the common defense and security. In making this determination, DOE will consider proposals made by the Contractor to avoid or mitigate foreign influences.</p>

<p>(3) If the cognizant security office at any time determines that the Contractor is, or is potentially, subject to foreign ownership, control, or influence, the Contractor shall comply with such instructions as the Contracting Officer shall provide in writing to protect any classified information or special nuclear material.</p>

<p>(4) The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for default either if the Contractor fails to meet obligations imposed by this clause or if the Contractor creates a foreign ownership, control, or influence situation in order to avoid performance or a termination for default. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience if the Contractor becomes subject to foreign ownership, control, or influence and for reasons other than avoidance of performance of the contract, cannot, or chooses not to, avoid or mitigate the foreign ownership, control, or influence problem.</p>

<p>(k) <i>Employment announcements.</i> When placing announcements seeking applicants for positions requiring access authorizations, the Contractor shall include in the written vacancy announcement, a notification to prospective applicants that reviews, and tests for the absence of any illegal drug as defined in 10 CFR 707.4, will be conducted by the employer and a background investigation by the Federal government may be required to obtain an access authorization prior to employment, and that subsequent reinvestigations may be required. If the position is covered by the Counterintelligence Evaluation Program regulations at 10 CFR part 709, the announcement should also alert applicants that successful completion of a counterintelligence evaluation may include a counterintelligence-scope polygraph examination.</p>

<p>(l) <i>Flow down to subcontracts.</i> The Contractor agrees to insert terms that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts under its contract that will require subcontractor employees to possess access authorizations. Additionally, the Contractor must require such subcontractors to have an existing DOD or DOE facility clearance or submit a completed SF 328, <i>Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests</i>, as required in 48 CFR 952.204-73, Facility Clearance, and obtain a foreign ownership, control and influence determination and facility clearance prior to award of a subcontract. Information to be provided by a subcontractor pursuant to this clause may be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer. For purposes of this clause, subcontractor means any subcontractor at any tier and the term “Contracting Officer” means the DOE Contracting Officer. When this clause is included in a subcontract, the term “Contractor” shall mean subcontractor and the term “contract” shall mean subcontract.</p>

<p>As prescribed in 904.404(d)(2), the following clause shall be included in all contracts which involve classified information:</p>

<p><b>Classification/Declassification (SEP 1997)</b></p>

<p>In the performance of work under this contract, the Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with all provisions of the Department of Energy's regulations and mandatory DOE directives which apply to work involving the classification and declassification of information, documents, or material. In this section, “information” means facts, data, or knowledge itself; “document” means the physical medium on or in which information is recorded; and “material” means a product or substance which contains or reveals information, regardless of its physical form or characteristics. Classified information is “Restricted Data” and “Formerly Restricted Data” (classified under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended) and “National Security Information” (classified under Executive Order 12958 or prior Executive Orders).</p>

<p>The original decision to classify or declassify information is considered an inherently Governmental function. For this reason, only Government personnel may serve as original classifiers, i.e., Federal Government Original Classifiers. Other personnel (Government or Contractor) may serve as derivative classifiers which involves making classification decisions based upon classification guidance which reflect decisions made by Federal Government Original Classifiers.</p>

<p>The Contractor or subcontractor shall ensure that any document or material that may contain classified information is reviewed by either a Federal Government or a Contractor Derivative Classifier in accordance with classification regulations including mandatory DOE directives and classification/declassification guidance furnished to the Contractor by the Department of Energy to determine whether it contains classified information prior to dissemination. For information which is not addressed in classification/declassification guidance, but whose sensitivity appears to warrant classification, the Contractor or subcontractor shall ensure that such information is reviewed by a Federal Government Original Classifier.</p>

<p>In addition, the Contractor or subcontractor shall ensure that existing classified documents (containing either Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data or National Security Information) which are in its possession or under its control are periodically reviewed by a Federal Government or Contractor Derivative Declassifier in accordance with classification regulations, mandatory DOE directives and classification/declassification guidance furnished to the Contractor by the Department of Energy to determine if the documents are no longer appropriately classified. Priorities for declassification review of classified documents shall be based on the degree of public and researcher interest and the likelihood of declassification upon review. Documents which no longer contain classified information are to be declassified. Declassified documents then shall be reviewed to determine if they are publicly releasable. Documents which are declassified and determined to be publicly releasable are to be made available to the public in order to maximize the public's access to as much Government information as possible while minimizing security costs.</p>

<p>The Contractor or subcontractor shall insert this clause in any subcontract which involves or may involve access to classified information.</p>

<p>As prescribed in 904.404(d)(5), insert the following provision in all solicitations which require the use of Standard Form 328, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, for contracts or subcontracts subject to the provisions of 904.70: </p>

<p><b>Facility Clearance (AUG 2016)</b></p>

<p><b>Notices </b></p>

<p>Section 2536 of title 10, United States Code, prohibits the award of a contract under a national security program to an entity controlled by a foreign government if it is necessary for that entity to be given access to information in a proscribed category of information in order to perform the contract unless a waiver is granted by the Secretary of Energy. In addition, a Facility Clearance and foreign ownership, control and influence (FOCI) information are required when the contract or subcontract to be awarded is expected to require employees to have access authorizations. </p>

<p>Offerors who have either a Department of Defense or a Department of Energy Facility Clearance generally need not resubmit the following foreign ownership information unless specifically requested to do so. Instead, provide your DOE Facility Clearance code or your DOD assigned commercial and government entity (CAGE) code. If uncertain, consult the office which issued this solicitation. </p>

<p>(a) <i>Use of Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, Standard Form 328.</i> (1) The contract work anticipated by this solicitation will require access to classified information or special nuclear material. Such access will require a Facility Clearance for the Contractor's organization and access authorizations (security clearances) for Contractor personnel working with the classified information or special nuclear material. To obtain a Facility Clearance the Contractor must submit the Standard Form 328, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, and all required supporting documents to form a complete Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) Package. The Contractor will submit the Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) information in the format directed by DOE. When completed the Contractor must print and sign one copy of the SF 328 and submit it to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(2) Information submitted by the offeror in response to the Standard Form 328 will be used solely for the purposes of evaluating foreign ownership, control or influence and will be treated by DOE, to the extent permitted by law, as business or financial information submitted in confidence. </p>

<p>(3) Following submission of a Standard Form 328 and prior to contract award, the Contractor shall immediately submit to the Contracting Officer written notification of any changes in the extent and nature of FOCI which could affect the offeror's answers to the questions in Standard Form 328. Following award of a contract, the Contractor must immediately submit to the cognizant security office written notification of any changes in the extent and nature of FOCI which could affect the offeror's answers to the questions in Standard Form 328. Notice of changes in ownership or control which are required to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, or the Department of Justice must also be furnished concurrently to the cognizant security office. </p>

<p>(b) <i>Definitions.</i> (1) <i>Foreign Interest</i> means any of the following—</p>

<p>(i) A foreign government, foreign government agency, or representative of a foreign government; </p>

<p>(ii) Any form of business enterprise or legal entity organized, chartered or incorporated under the laws of any country other than the United States or its possessions and trust territories; and </p>

<p>(iii) Any person who is not a citizen or national of the United States. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI)</i> means the situation where the degree of ownership, control, or influence over a Contractor by a foreign interest is such that a reasonable basis exists for concluding that compromise of classified information or special nuclear material may result.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Facility Clearance</i> means an administrative determination that a facility is eligible to access, produce, use or store classified information, or special nuclear material. A Facility Clearance is based upon a determination that satisfactory safeguards and security measures are carried out for the activities being performed at the facility. It is DOE policy that all Contractors or Subcontractors requiring access authorizations be processed for a Facility Clearance at the level appropriate to the activities being performed under the contract. Approval for a Facility Clearance shall be based upon—</p>

<p>(1) A favorable foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) determination based upon the Contractor's response to the ten questions in Standard Form 328 and any required, supporting data provided by the Contractor;</p>

<p>(2) A contract or proposed contract containing the appropriate security clauses;</p>

<p>(3) Approved safeguards and security plans which describe protective measures appropriate to the activities being performed at the facility;</p>

<p>(4) An established Reporting Identification Symbol code for the Nuclear Materials Management and Safeguards Reporting System if access to nuclear materials is involved;</p>

<p>(5) A survey conducted no more than 6 months before the Facility Clearance date, with a composite facility rating of satisfactory, if the facility is to possess classified matter or special nuclear material at its location;</p>

<p>(6) Appointment of a Facility Security Officer, who must possess or be in the process of obtaining an access authorization equivalent to the Facility Clearance; and, if applicable, appointment of a Materials Control and Accountability Representative; and</p>

<p>(7) Access authorizations for key management personnel who will be determined on a case-by-case basis, and must possess or be in the process of obtaining access authorizations equivalent to the level of the Facility Clearance.</p>

<p>(d) A Facility Clearance is required prior to the award of a contract requiring access to classified information and the granting of any access authorizations under a contract. Prior to award of a contract, the DOE must determine that award of the contract to the offeror will not pose an undue risk to the common defense and security as a result of its access to classified information or special nuclear material in the performance of the contract. The Contracting Officer may require the offeror to submit such additional information as deemed pertinent to this determination.</p>

<p>(e) A Facility Clearance is required even for contracts that do not require the Contractor's corporate offices to receive, process, reproduce, store, transmit, or handle classified information or special nuclear material, but which require DOE access authorizations for the Contractor's employees to perform work at a DOE location. This type facility is identified as a non-possessing facility.</p>

<p>(f) Except as otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the provisions of any resulting contract must require that the Contractor insert provisions similar to the foregoing in all subcontracts and purchase orders. Any Subcontractors requiring access authorizations for access to classified information or special nuclear material shall be directed to provide responses to the questions in Standard Form 328, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, directly to the prime Contractor or the Contracting Officer for the prime contract.</p>

<p><b>Notice to Offerors—Contents Review (Please Review Before Submitting)</b></p>

<p>Prior to submitting the Standard Form 328, required by paragraph (a)(1) of this clause, the offeror should review the FOCI submission to ensure that:</p>

<p>(a) <i>General.</i> (1) The payment of fee or profit (i.e., award fee, fixed fee, and incentive fee or profit) under this contract is dependent upon the Contractor's compliance with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information (i.e., Formerly Restricted Data and National Security Information) including compliance with applicable law, regulation, and DOE directives. The term “Contractor” as used in this clause to address failure to comply shall mean “Contractor or Contractor employee.”</p>

<p>(2) In addition to other remedies available to the Government, if the Contractor fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally reduce the amount of fee or profit that is otherwise payable to the Contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions of this clause.</p>

<p>(3) Any reduction in the amount of fee or profit earned by the Contractor will be determined by the severity of the Contractor's failure to comply with contract terms and conditions relating to the safeguarding of restricted data or other classified information pursuant to the degrees specified in paragraph (c) of this clause.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Reduction amount.</i> (1) If in any period (see 48 CFR 952.204-76 (b)(2)) it is found that the Contractor has failed to comply with contract terms and conditions relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information, the Contractor's fee or profit of the period may be reduced. Such reduction shall not be less than 26 percent nor greater than 100 percent of the total fee or profit earned for a first degree performance failure, not less than 11 percent nor greater than 25 percent for a second degree performance failure, and up to 10 percent for a third degree performance failure. The Contracting Officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the specified range (see 48 CFR 904.402(c)). The mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<p>(i) Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident.</p>

<p>(ii) Efforts the Contractor had made to anticipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance.</p>

<p>(iii) Contractor self-identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence.</p>

<p>(iv) General status (trend and absolute performance) of safeguarding Restricted Data and other classified information and compliance in related security areas.</p>

<p>(2)(i) Except in the case of performance-based firm-fixed-price contracts (see paragraph (b)(3) of this clause), the Contracting Officer, for purposes of this clause, will at the time of contract award, or as soon as practicable thereafter, allocate the total amount of fee or profit that is available under this contract to equal periods of [insert 6 or 12] months to run sequentially for the entire term of the contract (i.e., from the effective date of the contract to the expiration date of the contract, including all options). The amount of fee or profit to be allocated to each period shall be equal to the average monthly fee or profit that is available or otherwise payable during the entire term of the contract, multiplied by the number of months established above for each period.</p>

<p>(ii) Under this clause, the total amount of fee or profit that is subject to reduction in a period in which a performance failure occurs, in combination with any reduction made under any other clause in the contract that provides for a reduction to the fee or profit, shall not exceed the amount of fee or profit that is earned by the Contractor in the period established pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this clause.</p>

<p>(3) For performance-based firm-fixed-price contracts, the Contracting Officer will at the time of contract award include negative monetary incentives in the contract for Contractor violations relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Safeguarding restricted data and other classified information.</i> Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. The degrees of performance failures relating to the Contractor's obligations under this contract for safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) <i>First Degree:</i> Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, exceptionally grave damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered first degree:</p>

<p>(i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating a risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a Special Access Program (SAP), information identified as sensitive compartmented information (SCI), or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.</p>

<p>(ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.</p>

<p>(iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.</p>

<p>(iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.</p>

In addition, this category includes performance failures that result from a lack of Contractor management and/or employee attention to the proper safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. These performance failures may be indicators of future, more severe performance failures and/or conditions, and if identified and corrected early would prevent serious incidents.

<p>(i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other information classified as Confidential.</p>

<p>(ii) Failure to promptly report alleged or suspected violations of laws, regulations, or directives pertaining to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information.</p>

<p>(iii) Failure to identify or timely execute corrective actions to mitigate or eliminate identified vulnerabilities and reduce residual risk relating to the protection of Restricted Data or other classified information in accordance with the Contractor's Safeguards and Security Plan or other security plan, as applicable.</p>

<p>(iv) Contractor actions that result in performance failures which unto themselves pose minor risk, but when viewed in the aggregate indicate degradation in the integrity of the Contractor's safeguards and security management system relating to the protection of Restricted Data and other classified information.</p>

<p><b>Organizational Conflicts of Interest (AUG 2009)</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Purpose.</i> The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the Contractor (1) is not biased because of its financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) does not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Scope.</i> The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the Contractor and any of its affiliates or their successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Contractor”) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime Contractor, subcontractor, cosponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Use of contractor's work product.</i> (i) The Contractor shall be ineligible to participate in any capacity in Department contracts, subcontracts, or proposals therefore (solicited and unsolicited) which stem directly from the Contractor's performance of work under this contract for a period of (Contracting Officer see 48 CFR 909.507-2 and enter specific term) years after the completion of this contract. Furthermore, unless so directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not perform any advisory and assistance services work under this contract on any of its products or services or the products or services of another firm if the Contractor is or has been substantially involved in their development or marketing. Nothing in this subparagraph shall preclude the Contractor from competing for follow-on contracts for advisory and assistance services.</p>

<p>(ii) If, under this contract, the Contractor prepares a complete or essentially complete statement of work or specifications to be used in competitive acquisitions, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform or participate in any capacity in any contractual effort which is based on such statement of work or specifications. The Contractor shall not incorporate its products or services in such statement of work or specifications unless so directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, in which case the restriction in this subparagraph shall not apply.</p>

<p>(iii) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Contractor from offering or selling its standard and commercial items to the Government.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Access to and use of information.</i> (i) If the Contractor, in the performance of this contract, obtains access to information, such as Department plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or data which has not been released or otherwise made available to the public, the Contractor agrees that without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer it shall not—</p>

<p>(A) use such information for any private purpose unless the information has been released or otherwise made available to the public;</p>

<p>(B) compete for work for the Department based on such information for a period of six (6) months after either the completion of this contract or until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public, whichever is first;</p>

<p>(C) submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government which is based on such information until one year after such information is released or otherwise made available to the public; and</p>

<p>(D) release such information unless such information has previously been released or otherwise made available to the public by the Department.</p>

<p>(ii) In addition, the Contractor agrees that to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information under this contract, it shall treat such information in accordance with any restrictions imposed on such information.</p>

<p>(iii) The Contractor may use technical data it first produces under this contract for its private purposes consistent with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A) and (D) of this clause and the patent, rights in data, and security provisions of this contract.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Disclosure after award.</i> (1) The Contractor agrees that, if changes, including additions, to the facts disclosed by it prior to award of this contract, occur during the performance of this contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure of such changes in writing to the Contracting Officer. Such disclosure may include a description of any action which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. The Department may, however, terminate the contract for convenience if it deems such termination to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<p>(2) In the event that the Contractor was aware of facts required to be disclosed or the existence of an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest and did not disclose such facts or such conflict of interest to the Contracting Officer, DOE may terminate this contract for default.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Remedies.</i> For breach of any of the above restrictions or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any facts required to be disclosed concerning this contract, including the existence of an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest at the time of or after award, the Government may terminate the contract for default, disqualify the Contractor from subsequent related contractual efforts, and pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>

<p>(e) <i>Waiver.</i> Requests for waiver under this clause shall be directed in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a full description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. If it is determined to be in the best interests of the Government, the Contracting Officer may grant such a waiver in writing.</p>

<p><i>Alterate I:</i> In accordance with 909.507-2 and 970.0905, include the following alternate in the specified types of contracts.</p>

<p>(f) <i>Subcontracts.</i> (1) The Contractor shall include a clause, substantially similar to this clause, including this paragraph (f), in subcontracts expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold determined in accordance with 48 CFR part 13 and involving the performance of advisory and assistance services as that term is defined at 48 CFR 2.101. The terms “contract,” “Contractor,” and “contracting officer” shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>

<p>(2) Prior to the award under this contract of any such subcontracts for advisory and assistance services, the Contractor shall obtain from the proposed subcontractor or consultant the disclosure required by 48 CFR 909.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual or significant potential for an organizational conflict of interest. Where an actual or significant potential organizational conflict of interest is identified, the Contractor shall take actions to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate the organizational conflict to the satisfaction of the Contractor. If the conflict cannot be avoided or neutralized, the Contractor must obtain the approval of the DOE Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.</p>

<p>As prescribed at 923.7003(f), insert the following clause:</p>

<p><b>Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health (DEC 2010)</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>General.</i> (1) The payment of fee or profit (i.e., award fee, fixed fee, and incentive fee or profit) under this contract is dependent upon the Contractor's compliance with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information (i.e., Formerly Restricted Data and National Security Information) and relating to the protection of worker safety and health, including compliance with applicable law, regulation, and DOE directives. The term “contractor” as used in this clause to address failure to comply shall mean “contractor or contractor employee.”</p>

<p>(2) In addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, if the Contractor fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information or relating to the protection of worker safety and health, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally reduce the amount of fee or profit that is otherwise payable to the Contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions of this clause.</p>

<p>(3) Any reduction in the amount of fee or profit earned by the Contractor will be determined by the severity of the Contractor's failure to comply with contract terms and conditions relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information or relating to worker safety and health pursuant to the degrees specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this clause.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Reduction amount.</i> (1) If in any period (see paragraph (b)(2) of this clause) it is found that the Contractor has failed to comply with contract terms and conditions relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information or relating to the protection of worker safety and health, the Contractor's fee or profit of the period may be reduced. Such reduction shall not be less than 26 percent nor greater than 100 percent of the total fee or profit earned for a first degree performance failure, not less than 11 percent nor greater than 25 percent for a second degree performance failure, and up to 10 percent for a third degree performance failure. The Contracting Officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the specified range (see 48 CFR 904.402(c) and 48 CFR 923.7002(a)(2)). The mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the following ((v), (vi), (vii), and (viii) apply to worker safety and health (WS&amp;H) only :</p>

<p>(i) Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident.</p>

<p>(ii) Efforts the Contractor had made to anticipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance.</p>

<p>(iii) Contractor self-identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence.</p>

<p>(iv) General status (trend and absolute performance) of: Safeguarding Restricted Data and other classified information and compliance in related security areas; or of protecting WS&amp;H and compliance in related areas.</p>

<p>(v) Contractor demonstration to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the principles of industrial WS&amp;H standards are routinely practiced (e.g., Voluntary Protection Program Star Status).</p>

<p>(vi) Event caused by “Good Samaritan” act by the Contractor (e.g., offsite emergency response).</p>

<p>(vii) Contractor demonstration that a performance measurement system is routinely used to improve and maintain WS&amp;H performance (including effective resource allocation) and to support DOE corporate decision-making (e.g., policy, WS&amp;H programs).</p>

<p>(viii) Contractor demonstration that an Operating Experience and Feedback Program is functioning that demonstrably affects continuous improvement in WS&amp;H by use of lessons-learned and best practices inter- and intra-DOE sites.</p>

<p>(2)(i) Except in the case of performance-based, firm-fixed-price contracts (see paragraph (b)(3) of this clause), the Contracting Officer, for purposes of this clause, will at the time of contract award, or as soon as practicable thereafter, allocate the total amount of fee or profit that is available under this contract to equal periods of [insert 6 or 12] months to run sequentially for the entire term of the contract (i.e., from the effective date of the contract to the expiration date of the contract, including all options). The amount of fee or profit to be allocated to each period shall be equal to the average monthly fee or profit that is available or otherwise payable during the entire term of the contract, multiplied by the number of months established above for each period.</p>

<p>(ii) Under this clause, the total amount of fee or profit that is subject to reduction in a period in which a performance failure occurs, in combination with any reduction made under any other clause in the contract that provides for a reduction to the fee or profit, shall not exceed the amount of fee or profit that is earned by the Contractor in the period established pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this clause.</p>

<p>(3) For performance-based firm-fixed-price contracts, the Contracting Officer will at the time of contract award include negative monetary incentives in the contract for Contractor violations relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information and relating to protection of worker safety and health.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Safeguarding restricted data and other classified information.</i> Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. The degrees of performance failures relating to the Contractor's obligations under this contract for safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) <i>First Degree:</i> Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, exceptionally grave damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered first degree:</p>

<p>(i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating a risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a Special Access Program (SAP), information identified as sensitive compartmented information (SCI), or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.</p>

<p>(ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.</p>

<p>(iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.</p>

<p>(iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other classified information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Second Degree:</i> Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, serious damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered second degree:</p>

<p>(i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret.</p>

<p>(ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Secret.</p>

<p>(iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other classified information regardless of classification (except for information covered by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this clause). </p>

<p>(iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Third Degree:</i> Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, undue risk to the common defense and security. In addition, this category includes performance failures that result from a lack of contractor management and/or employee attention to the proper safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. These performance failures may be indicators of future, more severe performance failures and/or conditions, and if identified and corrected early would prevent serious incidents. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree: </p>

<p>(i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other information classified as Confidential. </p>

<p>(ii) Failure to promptly report alleged or suspected violations of laws, regulations, or directives pertaining to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information. </p>

<p>(iii) Failure to identify or timely execute corrective actions to mitigate or eliminate identified vulnerabilities and reduce residual risk relating to the protection of Restricted Data or other classified information in accordance with the Contractor's Safeguards and Security Plan or other security plan, as applicable. </p>

<p>(iv) Contractor actions that result in performance failures which unto themselves pose minor risk, but when viewed in the aggregate indicate degradation in the integrity of the Contractor's safeguards and security management system relating to the protection of Restricted Data and other classified information. </p>

<p>(d) <i>Protection of worker safety and health.</i> Performance failures occur if the contractor does not comply with the contract's WS&amp;H terms and conditions, which may be included in the DOE approved contractor Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS). The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of fee or profit will be determined are: </p>

<p>(1) <i>First Degree:</i> Performance failures that are most adverse to WS&amp;H or could threaten the successful completion of a program or project. For contracts including ISMS requirements, failure to develop and obtain required DOE approval of WS&amp;H aspects of an ISMS is considered first degree. The Government will perform necessary review of the ISMS in a timely manner and will not unreasonably withhold approval of the WS&amp;H aspects of the Contractor's ISMS. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be deemed first degree: </p>

<p>(i) Type A accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1A, Accident Investigations, or its successor).</p>

<p>(ii) Two Second Degree performance failures during an evaluation period. </p>

<p>(2) <i>Second Degree:</i> Performance failures that are significantly adverse to WS&amp;H. They include failures to comply with approved WS&amp;H aspects of an ISMS that result in an actual injury, exposure, or exceedence that occurred or nearly occurred but had minor practical long-term health consequences. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered second degree: </p>

<p>(i) Type B accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1A, Accident Investigations, or its successor).</p>

<p>(ii) Non-compliance with approved WS&amp;H aspects of an ISMS that results in a near miss of a Type A or B accident. A near miss is a situation in which an inappropriate action occurs, or a necessary action is omitted, but does not result in an adverse effect. </p>

<p>(iii) Failure to mitigate or notify DOE of an imminent danger situation after discovery, where such notification is a requirement of the contract. </p>

<p>(3) <i>Third Degree:</i> Performance failures that reflect a lack of focus on improving WS&amp;H. They include failures to comply with approved WS&amp;H aspects of an ISMS that result in potential breakdown of the Contractor's WS&amp;H system. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree: </p>

<p>(i) Failure to implement effective corrective actions to address deficiencies/non-compliance documented through external (<i>e.g.,</i> Federal) oversight and/or reported per DOE Manual 231.1-2, Occurrence Reporting and Processing of Operations Information, or its successor, requirements, or internal oversight of DOE Order 470.2B, Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance Program, or its successor, requirements.</p>

<p>(ii) Multiple similar non-compliances identified by external (e.g., Federal) oversight that in aggregate indicate a significant WS&amp;H system breakdown. </p>

<p>(iii) Non-compliances that either have, or may have, significant negative impacts to workers that indicate a significant WS&amp;H system breakdown. </p>

<p>(iv) Failure to notify DOE upon discovery of events or conditions where notification is required by the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>

The subcontractor, if subcontracting opportunities for sustainable and environmentally preferable products or services exceed the threshold in paragraph (f) of this clause, will comply with the procedures in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this clause regarding the collection of all data necessary to generate the reports required under paragraphs (c) through (f) of this clause, and submit the reports directly to the Prime Contractor's Environmental Sustainability Coordinator at the supported facility. The subcontractor will advise the contractor if it is unable to procure energy efficient and environmentally sustainable items and cite which of the reasons in paragraph (c) of this clause apply. The reports may be submitted at the conclusion of the subcontract term provided that the subcontract delivery term is not multi-year in nature. If the delivery term is multi-year, the subcontractor shall report its accomplishments for each Federal fiscal year in a manner and at a time or times acceptable to both parties. Failure to comply with these reporting requirements may be considered a breach of contract with attendant consequences.</p>

<p>(i) When this clause is used in a subcontract, the word “Contractor” will be understood to mean “Subcontractor.”</p>

<p>As prescribed in 925.7004, insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts:</p>

<p><b>Subcontracting for Nuclear Hot Cell Services (MAR 1993)</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Definitions. Costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities,</i> as used in this clause, means any cost associated with the compliance with regulatory requirements governing the decommissioning of nuclear facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Such costs for foreign facilities and for Department of Energy facilities are costs of decommissioning associated with the compliance with foreign regulatory requirements or the Department's own requirements.</p>

<p><i>Costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste,</i> as used in this clause, means any costs, whether required by regulation or incurred as a matter of prudent business practice, associated with the storage or disposal of nuclear waste.</p>

<p><i>Foreign company,</i> as used in this clause, means a company which offers to perform nuclear hot cell services at a facility which is not subject to the laws and regulations of the United States, its agencies, and its political subdivisions.</p>

<p><i>Nuclear hot cell services,</i> as used in this clause, means services related to the examination of, or performance of various operations on, nuclear fuel rods, control assemblies, or other components that are emitting large quantities of ionizing radiation, after discharge from nuclear reactors, which are performed in specialized facilities located away from commercial nuclear power plants, generally referred to in the industry as “hot cells.”</p>

<p><i>Nuclear waste,</i> as used in this clause, means any radioactive waste material subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the Department of Energy, or in the case of foreign offers, by comparable foreign organizations.</p>

<p><i>United States company,</i> as used in this clause, means a company which offers to perform nuclear hot cell services at a facility subject to the laws and regulations of the United States, its agencies, and its political subdivisions.</p>

<p>(b) In selecting a competitive offer for a first-tier subcontract acquisition of nuclear hot cell services, the Contractor shall—</p>

<p>(1) Consider neither costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear waste facilities nor costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste; or</p>

<p>(2) Add these costs to offers of foreign companies, if—</p>

<p>(i) One or more of the offers is submitted by a United States company and includes costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste because it is subject to such cost; and</p>

<p>(ii) One or more of the offers is submitted by a foreign company and does not include these types of costs. (A foreign company might not be subject to such costs or might not have to include these types of cost in its offer if the firm is subsidized in decommissioning activity or storage and disposal of nuclear waste, or a foreign government is performing the activities below the actual cost of the activity.)</p>

<p>(c) Upon determining that no offer from a foreign firm has a reasonable chance of being selected for award, the requirements of this clause will not apply.</p>

<p><b>COMPLIANCE WITH EXPORT CONTROL LAWS AND REGULATIONS (NOV 2015)</b></p>

<p>(a) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations.</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>

<p>(c) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds to, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations, including but not limited to—</p>

<p>(1) The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 <i>et seq.</i>), as amended;</p>

<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 <i>et seq.</i>);</p>

<p>(4) Trading with the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 5(b), as amended by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961);</p>

<p>(9) The regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury (31 CFR parts 500 through 598).</p>

<p>(d) In addition to the Federal laws and regulations cited above, National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189, National Policy on the Transfer of Scientific, Technical, and Engineering Information, establishes a national policy that, to the maximum extent possible, the products of fundamental research shall remain unrestricted. NSDD 189 provides that no restrictions may be placed upon the conduct or reporting of federally funded fundamental research that has not received national security classification, except as provided in applicable U.S. statutes. As a result, contracts confined to the performance of unclassified fundamental research generally do not involve any export-controlled activities.</p>

<p>NSDD 189 does not take precedence over statutes. NSDD 189 does not exempt any research from statutes that apply to export controls such as the Atomic Energy Act, as amended; the Arms Export Control Act; the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended; or the U.S. International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or regulations that implement parts of those statutes (<i>e.g.,</i> the ITAR, the EAR, 10 CFR part 110 and 10 CFR part 810). Thus, if items (<i>e.g.,</i> commodities, software or technologies) that are controlled by U.S. export control laws or regulations are used to conduct research or are generated as part of the research efforts, export control laws and regulations apply to the controlled items.</p>

<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all solicitations and subcontracts.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Made</i> when used in relation to any invention means the conception of first actual reduction to practice of such invention.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Nonprofit organization</i> means a university or other institution of higher education or an organization of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified under a state nonprofit organization statute.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Practical application</i> means to manufacture, in the case of a composition or product; to practice, in the case of a process or method; or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Small business firm</i> means a small business concern as defined at section 2 of Public Law 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) and implementing regulations of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. For the purpose of this clause, the size standards for small business concerns involved in Government procurement and subcontracting at 13 CFR 121.3-8 and 13 CFR 121.3-12, respectively, will be used.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Subject invention</i> means any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under this contract, provided that in the case of a variety of plant, the date of determination (as defined in section 41(d) of the Plant Variety Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during the period of contract performance.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Agency licensing regulations</i> and <i>agency regulations concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions</i> mean the Department of Energy patent licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Allocation of principal rights.</i> The Contractor may retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject invention subject to the provisions of this clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention in which the Contractor retains title, the Federal Government shall have a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention throughout the world.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Invention disclosure, election of title, and filing of patent application by Contractor.</i> (1) The Contractor will disclose each subject invention to the Department of Energy (DOE) within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to DOE shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to the DOE, the Contractor will promptly notify that agency of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Contractor.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying DOE within 2 years of disclosure to DOE. However, in any case where publication, on sale or public use has initiated the l-year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by DOE to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor will file its initial patent application on a subject invention to which it elects to retain title within 1 year after election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Contractor will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either 10 months of the corresponding initial patent application or 6 months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.</p>

<p>(4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure, election, and filing under subparagraphs (c)(l), (2), and (3) of this clause may, at the discretion of the agency, be granted.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Conditions when the Government may obtain title.</i> The Contractor will convey to the Federal agency, upon written request, title to any subject invention—</p>

<p>(1) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect title to the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, or elects not to retain title; provided, that DOE may only request title within 60 days after learning of the failure of the Contractor to disclose or elect within the specified times.</p>

<p>(2) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the Federal agency, the Contractor shall continue to retain title in that country.</p>

<p>(3) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.</p>

<p>(e) <i>Minimum rights to Contractor and protection of the Contractor right to file.</i> (1) The Contractor will retain a nonexclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the Contractor fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. The Contractor's license extends to its domestic subsidiary and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of the Federal agency, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 and agency licensing regulations. This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.</p>

<p>(3) Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and agency regulations concerning the licensing of Government owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.</p>

<p>(f) <i>Contractor action to protect the Government's interest.</i> (1) The Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to DOE all instruments necessary to (i) establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions to which the Contractor elects to retain title, and (ii) convey title to DOE when requested under paragraph (d) of this clause and to enable the government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor will notify DOE of any decision not to continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.</p>

<p>(4) The Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent application and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement, “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by the United States Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.”</p>

<p>(g) <i>Subcontracts.</i> (1) The Contractor will include this clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization. The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the Contractor in this clause, and the Contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.</p>

<p>(2) The contractor shall include in all other subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration, or research work the patent rights clause at 952.227-13.</p>

<p>(3) In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, DOE, subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.</p>

<p>(h) <i>Reporting on utilization of subject inventions.</i> The Contractor agrees to submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received, by the Contractor, and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by that agency in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor.</p>

<p>(i) <i>Preference for United States industry.</i> Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</p>

<p>(j) <i>March-in rights.</i> The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of the agency to require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and, if the Contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself if DOE determines that—</p>

<p>(1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;</p>

<p>(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their licensees;</p>

<p>(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or</p>

<p>(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this clause has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.</p>

<p>(k) <i>Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations.</i> If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that—</p>

<p>(1) Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned without the approval of the Federal agency, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions; provided, that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the Contractor;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor will share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (when DOE deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;</p>

<p>(3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the Contractor with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions will be utilized for the support of scientific research or education; and</p>

<p>(4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms, and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the contractor. However, the Contractor agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and the Contractor will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when that Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of this subparagraph (k)(4).</p>

<p>(l) <i>Communications.</i> (1) The contractor shall direct any notification, disclosure, or request to DOE provided for in this clause to the DOE patent counsel assisting the DOE contracting activity, with a copy of the communication to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(2) Each exercise of discretion or decision provided for in this clause, except subparagraph (k)(4), is reserved for the DOE Patent Counsel and is not a claim or dispute and is not subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.</p>

<p>(3) Upon request of the DOE Patent Counsel or the contracting officer, the contractor shall provide any or all of the following:</p>

<p>(i) A copy of the patent application, filing date, serial number and title, patent number, and issue date for any subject invention in any country in which the contractor has applied for a patent;</p>

<p>(ii) A report, not more often than annually, summarizing all subject inventions which were disclosed to DOE individually during the reporting period specified; or</p>

<p>(iii) A report, prior to closeout of the contract, listing all subject inventions or stating that there were none.</p>

<p>As prescribed at 927.303(a)(1), insert the following clause:</p>

<p><b>Patent Rights—Acquisition by the Government (SEP 1997)</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Definitions.</i></p>

<p><i>Invention,</i> as used in this clause, means any invention or discovery which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the United States Code or any novel variety of plant that is or may be protectable under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p><i>Practical application,</i> as used in this clause, means to manufacture, in the case of a composition or product; to practice, in the case of a process or method; or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.</p>

<p><i>Subject invention,</i> as used in this clause, means any invention of the Contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract.</p>

<p><i>Patent Counsel,</i> as used in this clause, means the Department of Energy Patent Counsel assisting the procuring activity.</p>

<p><i>DOE patent waiver regulations,</i> as used in this clause, means the Department of Energy patent waiver regulations in effect on the date of award of this contract. See 10 CFR part 784.</p>

<p><i>Agency licensing regulations</i> and <i>applicable agency licensing regulations,</i> as used in this clause, mean the Department of Energy patent licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Allocations of principal rights</i>—(1) <i>Assignment to the Government.</i> The Contractor agrees to assign to the Government the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world in and to each subject invention, except to the extent that rights are retained by the Contractor under subparagraph (b)(2) and paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Greater rights determinations.</i> (i) The Contractor, or an employee-inventor after consultation with the Contractor, may request greater rights than the nonexclusive license and the foreign patent rights provided in paragraph (d) of this clause on identified inventions in accordance with the DOE patent waiver regulations. A request for a determination of whether the Contractor or the employee-inventor is entitled to acquire such greater rights must be submitted to the Patent Counsel with a copy to the Contracting Officer at the time of the first disclosure of the invention pursuant to subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause, or not later than 8 months thereafter, unless a longer period is authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor. Each determination of greater rights under this contract shall be subject to paragraph (c) of this clause, unless otherwise provided in the greater rights determination, and to the reservations and conditions deemed to be appropriate by the Secretary of Energy or designee.</p>

<p>(ii) Within two (2) months after the filing of a patent application, the Contractor shall provide the filing date, serial number and title, a copy of the patent application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English), and, promptly upon issuance of a patent, provide the patent number and issue date for any subject invention in any country for which the Contractor has been granted title or the right to file and prosecute on behalf of the United States by the Department of Energy.</p>

<p>(iii) Not less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the response period for any action required by the Patent and Trademark Office, notify the Patent Counsel of any decision not to continue prosecution of the application.</p>

<p>(iv) Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Government an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of the patent application file.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Minimum rights acquired by the Government.</i> (1) With respect to each subject invention to which the Department of Energy grants the Contractor principal or exclusive rights, the Contractor agrees as follows:</p>

<p>(i) The Contractor hereby grants to the Government a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced each subject invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the Government of the United States (including any Government agency).</p>

<p>(ii) The Contractor agrees that with respect to any subject invention in which DOE has granted it title, DOE has the right in accordance with the procedures in the DOE patent waiver regulations (10 CFR part 784) to require the Contractor, an assignee, or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself if it determines that—</p>

<p>(A) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;</p>

<p>(B) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their licensees;</p>

<p>(C) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or</p>

<p>(D) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this clause has neither been obtained nor waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.</p>

<p>(iii) The Contractor agrees to submit on request periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with any march-in proceedings undertaken by that agency in accordance with subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of this clause. To the extent data or information supplied under this section is considered by the Contractor, its licensee, or assignee to be privileged and confidential and is so marked, the Department of Energy agrees that, to the extent permitted by law, it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government.</p>

<p>(iv) The Contractor agrees, when licensing a subject invention, to arrange to avoid royalty charges on acquisitions involving Government funds, including funds derived through a Military Assistance Program of the Government or otherwise derived through the Government, to refund any amounts received as royalty charges on a subject invention in acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the Government, and to provide for such refund in any instrument transferring rights in the invention to any party.</p>

<p>(v) The Contractor agrees to provide for the Government's paid-up license pursuant to subparagraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause in any instrument transferring rights in a subject invention and to provide for the granting of licenses as required by subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of this clause, and for the reporting of utilization information as required by subparagraph (c)(1)(iii) of this clause, whenever the instrument transfers principal or exclusive rights in a subject invention.</p>

<p>(2) Nothing contained in this paragraph (c) shall be deemed to grant to the Government any rights with respect to any invention other than a subject invention.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Minimum rights to the Contractor.</i> (1) The Contractor is hereby granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country on a subject invention and any resulting patent in which the Government obtains title, unless the Contractor fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor's license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a part and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions in 37 CFR part 404 and agency licensing regulations. This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical applications and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.</p>

<p>(3) Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable agency licensing regulations and 37 CFR part 404 concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.</p>

<p>(4) The Contractor may request the right to acquire patent rights to a subject invention in any foreign country where the Government has elected not to secure such rights, subject to the conditions in subparagraphs (d)(4)(i) through (d)(4)(vii) of this clause. Such request must be made in writing to the Patent Counsel as part of the disclosure required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause, with a copy to the DOE Contracting Officer. DOE approval, if given, will be based on a determination that this would best serve the national interest.</p>

<p>(i) The recipient of such rights, when specifically requested by DOE, and three years after issuance of a foreign patent disclosing the subject invention, shall furnish DOE a report stating:</p>

<p>(A) The commercial use that is being made, or is intended to be made, of said invention, and</p>

<p>(B) The steps taken to bring the invention to the point of practical application or to make the invention available for licensing.</p>

<p>(ii) The Government shall retain at least an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license to make, use, and sell the invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the Government (including any Government agency) and States and domestic municipal governments, unless the Secretary of Energy or designee determines that it would not be in the public interest to acquire the license for the States and domestic municipal governments.</p>

<p>(iii) If noted elsewhere in this contract as a condition of the grant of an advance waiver of the Government's title to inventions under this contract, or, if no advance waiver was granted but a waiver of the Government's title to an identified invention is granted pursuant to subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause upon a determination by the Secretary of Energy that it is in the Government's best interest, this license shall include the right of the Government to sublicense foreign governments pursuant to any existing or future treaty or agreement with such foreign governments.</p>

<p>(iv) Subject to the rights granted in subparagraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause, the Secretary of Energy or designee shall have the right to terminate the foreign patent rights granted in this subparagraph (d)(4) in whole or in part unless the recipient of such rights demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or designee that effective steps necessary to accomplish substantial utilization of the invention have been taken or within a reasonable time will be taken.</p>

<p>(v) Subject to the rights granted in subparagraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause, the Secretary of Energy or designee shall have the right, commencing four years after foreign patent rights are accorded under this subparagraph (d)(4), to require the granting of a nonexclusive or partially exclusive license to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms reasonable under the circumstances, and in appropriate circumstances to terminate said foreign patent rights in whole or in part, following a hearing upon notice thereof to the public, upon a petition by an interested person justifying such hearing:</p>

<p>(A) If the Secretary of Energy or designee determines, upon review of such material as he deems relevant, and after the recipient of such rights or other interested person has had the opportunity to provide such relevant and material information as the Secretary or designee may require, that such foreign patent rights have tended substantially to lessen competition or to result in undue market concentration in any section of the United States in any line of commerce to which the technology relates; or</p>

<p>(B) Unless the recipient of such rights demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or designee at such hearing that the recipient has taken effective steps, or within a reasonable time thereafter is expected to take such steps, necessary to accomplish substantial utilization of the invention.</p>

<p>(vi) If the contractor is to file a foreign patent application on a subject invention, the Government agrees, upon written request, to use its best efforts to withhold publication of such invention disclosures for such period of time as specified by Patent Counsel, but in no event shall the Government or its employees be liable for any publication thereof.</p>

<p>(vii) Subject to the license specified in subparagraphs (d) (1), (2), and (3) of this clause, the contractor or inventor agrees to convey to the Government, upon request, the entire right, title, and interest in any foreign country in which the contractor or inventor fails to have a patent application filed in a timely manner or decides not to continue prosecution or to pay any maintenance fees covering the invention. To avoid forfeiture of the patent application or patent, the contractor or inventor shall, not less than 60 days before the expiration period for any action required by any patent office, notify the Patent Counsel of such failure or decision, and deliver to the Patent Counsel, the executed instruments necessary for the conveyance specified in this paragraph.</p>

<p>(e) <i>Invention identification, disclosures, and reports.</i> (1) The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to assure that subject inventions are promptly identified and disclosed to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters within 6 months of conception and/or first actual reduction to practice, whichever occurs first in the performance of work under this contract. These procedures shall include the maintenance of laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as are reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual reduction to practice of subject inventions, and records that show that the procedures for identifying and disclosing the inventions are followed. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a description of such procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their effectiveness.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall disclose each subject invention to the DOE Patent Counsel with a copy to the Contracting Officer within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters or, if earlier, within 6 months after the Contractor becomes aware that a subject invention has been made, but in any event before any on sale, public use, or publication of such invention known to the Contractor. The disclosure to DOE shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding, to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and physical, chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale, or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to DOE, the Contractor shall promptly notify Patent Counsel of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Contractor. The report should also include any request for a greater rights determination in accordance with subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause. When an invention is disclosed to DOE under this paragraph, it shall be deemed to have been made in the manner specified in Sections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 42 U.S.C. 5908, unless the Contractor contends in writing at the time the invention is disclosed that is was not so made.</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the following:</p>

<p>(i) Interim reports every 12 months (or such longer period as may be specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract, listing all subject inventions during that period, and including a statment that all subject inventions have been disclosed (or that there are not such inventions), and that such disclosure has been made in accordance with the procedures required by paragraph (e)(1) of this clause.</p>

<p>(ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the contracted work listing all subject inventions or containing a statement that there were no such inventions, and listing all subcontracts at any tier containing a patent right clause or containing a statement that there were no such subcontracts.</p>

<p>(4) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause.</p>

<p>(5) The Contractor agrees, subject to FAR 27.302(j), that the Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause.</p>

<p>(f) <i>Examination of records relating to inventions.</i> (1) The Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of the Contractor relating to the conception or first actual reduction to practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under this contract to determine whether—</p>

<p>(i) Any such inventions are subject inventions;</p>

<p>(ii) The Contractor has established and maintains the procedures required by subparagraphs (e) (1) and (4) of this clause;</p>

<p>(iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the procedures.</p>

<p>(2) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor invention which the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject invention, the Contractor may be required to disclose the invention to DOE for a determination of ownership rights.</p>

<p>(3) Any examination of records under this paragraph will be subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.</p>

<p>(g) <i>Withholding of payment</i> (This paragraph does not apply to subcontracts).</p>

<p>(1) Any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount of this contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to—</p>

<p>(i) Convey to the Government, using a DOE-approved form, the title and/or rights of the Government in each subject invention as required by this clause.</p>

<p>(ii) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for identifying and disclosing subject inventions pursuant to subparagraph (e)(1) of this clause;</p>

<p>(iii) Disclose any subject invention pursuant to subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause;</p>

<p>(iv) Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to subparagraph (e)(3)(i) of this clause; or</p>

<p>(v) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to subparagraph (h)(4) of this clause.</p>

<p>(2) Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other information required by this clause.</p>

<p>(3) Final payment under this contract shall not be made before the Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer all disclosures of subject inventions required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause, and acceptable final report pursuant to subparagraph (e)(3)(ii) of this clause, and the Patent Counsel has issued a patent clearance certification to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums withheld up to the maximum authorized above. No amount shall be withheld under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government rights.</p>

<p>(h) <i>Subcontracts.</i> (1) The contractor shall include the clause at 48 CFR 952.227-11 (suitably modified to identify the parties) in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration, or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization, except where the work of the subcontract is subject to an Exceptional Circumstances Determination by DOE. In all other subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration, or research work, the contractor shall include this clause (suitably modified to identify the parties). The contractor shall not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.</p>

<p>(2) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to accept such a clause the Contractor—</p>

<p>(i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; and</p>

<p>(ii) Shall not proceed with such subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(3) In the case of subcontracts at any tier, DOE, the subcontractor, and Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to those matters covered by this clause.</p>

<p>(4) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.</p>

<p>(5) The contractor shall identify all subject inventions of the subcontractor of which it acquires knowledge in the performance of this contract and shall notify the Patent Counsel, with a copy to the contracting officer, promptly upon identification of the inventions.</p>

<p>(i) <i>Preference United States industry.</i> Unless provided otherwise, no Contractor that receives title to any subject invention and no assignee of any such Contractor shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement may be waived by the Government upon a showing by the Contractor or assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</p>

<p>(j) <i>Atomic energy.</i> (1) No claim for pecuniary award of compensation under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, shall be asserted with respect to any invention or discovery made or conceived in the course of or under this contract.</p>

<p>(2) Except as otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor will obtain patent agreements to effectuate the provisions of subparagraph (e)(1) of this clause from all persons who perform any part of the work under this contract, except nontechnical personnel, such as clerical employees and manual laborers.</p>

<p>(k) <i>Background patents.</i> (1) <i>Background patent</i> means a domestic patent covering an invention or discovery which is not a subject invention and which is owned or controlled by the Contractor at any time through the completion of this contract:</p>

<p>(i) Which the contractor, but not the Government, has the right to license to others without obligation to pay royalties thereon, and</p>

<p>(ii) Infringement of which cannot reasonably be avoided upon the practice of any specific process, method, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter (including relatively minor modifications thereof) which is a subject of the research, development, or demonstration work performed under this contract.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government a royalty-free, nonexclusive license under any background patent for purposes of practicing a subject of this contract by or for the Government in research, development, and demonstration work only.</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor also agrees that upon written application by DOE, it will grant to responsible parties, for purposes of practicing a subject of this contract, nonexclusive licenses under any background patent on terms that are reasonable under the circumstances. If, however, the Contractor believes that exclusive rights are necessary to achieve expeditious commercial development or utilization, then a request may be made to DOE for DOE approval of such licensing by the Contractor.</p>

<p>(4) Notwithstanding subparagraph (k)(3) of this clause, the contractor shall not be obligated to license any background patent if the Contractor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or designee that:</p>

<p>(i) A competitive alternative to the subject matter covered by said background patent is commercially available or readily introducible from one or more other sources; or</p>

<p>(ii) The Contractor or its licensees are supplying the subject matter covered by said background patent in sufficient quantity and at reasonable prices to satisfy market needs, or have taken effective steps or within a reasonable time are expected to take effective steps to so supply the subject matter.</p>

<p>(l) <i>Publication.</i> It is recognized that during the course of the work under this contract, the Contractor or its employees may from time to time desire to release or publish information regarding scientific or technical developments conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract. In order that public disclosure of such information will not adversely affect the patent interests of DOE or the Contractor, patent approval for release of publication shall be secured from Patent Counsel prior to any such release or publication.</p>

<p>(m) <i>Forfeiture of rights in unreported subject inventions.</i> (1) The Contractor shall forfeit and assign to the Government, at the request of the Secretary of Energy or designee, all rights in any subject invention which the Contractor fails to report to Patent Counsel within six months after the time the Contractor:</p>

<p>(i) Files or causes to be filed a United States or foreign patent application thereon; or</p>

<p>(ii) Submits the final report required by subparagraph (e)(2)(ii) of this clause, whichever is later.</p>

<p>(2) However, the Contractor shall not forfeit rights in a subject invention if, within the time specified in subparagraph (m)(1) of this clause, the Contractor:</p>

<p>(i) Prepares a written decision based upon a review of the record that the invention was neither conceived nor first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under the contract and delivers the decision to Patent Counsel, with a copy to the Contracting Officer; or</p>

<p>(ii) Contending that the invention is not a subject invention, the Contractor nevertheless discloses the invention and all facts pertinent to this contention to the Patent Counsel, with a copy to the Contracting Officer; or</p>

<p>(iii) Establishes that the failure to disclose did not result from the Contractor's fault or negligence.</p>

<p>(3) Pending written assignment of the patent application and patents on a subject invention determined by the Secretary of Energy or designee to be forfeited (such determination to be a final decision under the Disputes clause of this contract), the Contractor shall be deemed to hold the invention and the patent applications and patents pertaining thereto in trust for the Government. The forfeiture provision of this paragraph (m) shall be in addition to and shall not supersede other rights and remedies which the Government may have with respect to subject inventions.</p>

<p>(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the contractor shall procure and maintain such bonds and insurance as required by law or approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(2) The contractor may, with the approval of the Contracting Officer, maintain a self-insurance program in accordance with FAR 28.308; provided that, with respect to workers' compensation, the contractor is qualified pursuant to statutory authority.</p>

<p>(3) All bonds and insurance required by this clause shall be in a form and amount and for those periods as the Contracting Officer may require or approve and with sureties and insurers approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(c) The contractor agrees to submit for the Contracting Officer's approval, to the extent and in the manner required by the Contracting Officer, any other bonds and insurance that are maintained by the contractor in connection with the performance of this contract and for which the contractor seeks reimbursement. If an insurance cost (whether a premium for commercial insurance or related to self-insurance) includes a portion covering costs made unallowable elsewhere in the contract, and the share of the cost for coverage for the unallowable cost is determinable, the portion of the cost that is otherwise an allowable cost under this contract is reimbursable to the extent determined by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(d) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this clause, or specifically disallowed elsewhere in this contract, the contractor shall be reimbursed—</p>

<p>(1) For that portion of the reasonable cost of bonds and insurance allocable to this contract required in accordance with contract terms or approved under this clause, and</p>

<p>(2) For liabilities (and reasonable expenses incidental to such liabilities, including litigation costs) to third persons not compensated by insurance without regard to the limitation of cost or limitation of funds clause of this contract.</p>

<p>(e) The Government's liability under paragraph (d) of this clause is subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Nothing in this contract shall be construed as implying that the Congress will, at a later date, appropriate funds sufficient to meet deficiencies.</p>

<p>(f)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, the contractor shall not be reimbursed for liabilities to third parties, including contractor employees, and directly associated costs which may include but are not limited to litigation costs, counsel fees, judgment and settlements—</p>

<p>(i) Which are otherwise unallowable by law or the provisions of this contract, including the cost reimbursement limitations contained in 48 CFR part 970.31, as supplemented by 48 CFR part 931;</p>

<p>(ii) For which the contractor has failed to insure or to maintain insurance as required by law, this contract, or by the written direction of the Contracting Officer; or</p>

<p>(A) Willful misconduct;</p>

<p>(B) Lack of good faith; or</p>

<p>(2) Punitive damages are not allowable unless the act or failure to act which gave rise to the liability resulted from compliance with specific terms and conditions of the contract or written instructions from the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(3) The portion of the cost of insurance obtained by the contractor that is allocable to coverage of liabilities referred to in paragraph (f) of this clause is not allowable.</p>

<p><b>Research Misconduct (JUL 2005)</b></p>

<p>(a) The Contractor is responsible for maintaining the integrity of research performed pursuant to this contract award including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct as defined by this clause, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations, and adjudication of allegations of research misconduct in accordance with the requirements of this clause.</p>

<p>(b) Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor must conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of research misconduct. If the Contractor determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it must notify the Contracting Officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the Contractor must:</p>

<p>(1) Conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted.</p>

<p>(2) If the investigation leads to a finding of research misconduct, conduct an adjudication by a responsible official who was not involved in the inquiry or investigation and is separated organizationally from the element which conducted the investigation. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.</p>

<p>(3) Inform the Contracting Officer if an initial inquiry supports a formal investigation and, if requested by the Contracting Officer thereafter, keep the Contracting Officer informed of the results of the investigation and any subsequent adjudication. When an investigation is complete, the Contractor will forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response (if any).</p>

<p>(c) The Department of Energy (DOE) may elect to act in lieu of the Contractor in conducting an inquiry or investigation into an allegation of research misconduct if the Contracting Officer finds that—</p>

<p>(1) The research organization is not prepared to handle the allegation in a manner consistent with this clause;</p>

<p>(2) The allegation involves an entity of sufficiently small size that it cannot reasonably conduct the inquiry;</p>

<p>(3) DOE involvement is necessary to ensure the public heath, safety, and security, or to prevent harm to the public interest; or</p>

<p>(4) The allegation involves possible criminal misconduct.</p>

<p>(d) In conducting the activities under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause, the Contractor and the Department, if it elects to conduct the inquiry or investigation, shall adhere to the following guidelines:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Safeguards for information and subjects of allegations.</i> The Contractor shall provide safeguards to ensure that individuals may bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of the Contractor without suffering retribution. Safeguards include: protection against retaliation; fair and objective procedures for examining and resolving allegations; and diligence in protecting positions and reputations. The Contractor shall also provide the subjects of allegations confidence that their rights are protected and that the mere filing of an allegation of research misconduct will not result in an adverse action. Safeguards include timely written notice regarding substantive allegations against them, a description of the allegation and reasonable access to any evidence submitted to support the allegation or developed in response to an allegation and notice of any findings of research misconduct.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Objectivity and expertise.</i> The Contractor shall select individual(s) to inquire, investigate, and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct who have appropriate expertise and have no unresolved conflict of interest. The individual(s) who conducts an adjudication must not be the same individual(s) who conducted the inquiry or investigation, and must be separate organizationally from the element that conducted the inquiry or investigation.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Timeliness.</i> The Contractor shall coordinate, inquire, investigate and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct promptly, but thoroughly. Generally, an investigation should be completed within 120 days of initiation, and adjudication should be complete within 60 days of receipt of the record of investigation.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Confidentiality.</i> To the extent possible, consistent with fair and thorough processing of allegations of research misconduct and applicable law and regulation, knowledge about the identity of the subjects of allegations and informants should be limited to those with a need to know.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Remediation and sanction.</i> If the Contractor finds that research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process. The Contractor must take all necessary corrective actions. Such action may include but are not limited to, correcting the research record and as appropriate imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future. The Contractor must coordinate remedial actions with the Contracting Officer. The Contractor must also consider whether personnel sanctions are appropriate. Any such sanction must be considered and effected consistent with any applicable personnel laws, policies, and procedures, and shall take into account the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact, whether it was done knowingly or intentionally, and whether it was an isolated event or pattern of conduct.</p>

<p>(e) DOE reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the award instrument and applicable laws and regulations. However, the Contractor's good faith administration of this clause and the effectiveness of its remedial actions and sanctions shall be positive considerations and shall be taken into account as mitigating factors in assessing the need for such actions. If DOE pursues any such action, it will inform the subject of the action of the outcome and any applicable appeal procedures.</p>

<p>(f) <i>Definitions.</i></p>

<p><i>Adjudication</i> means a formal review of a record of investigation of alleged research misconduct to determine whether and what corrective actions and sanctions should be taken.</p>

<p><i>Fabrication</i> means making up data or results and recording or reporting them.</p>

<p><i>Falsification</i> means manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.</p>

<p><i>Finding of Research Misconduct</i> means a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that research misconduct has occurred. Such a finding requires a conclusion that there has been a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community and that it be knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly committed.</p>

<p><i>Inquiry</i> means information gathering and initial fact-finding to determine whether an allegation or apparent instance of misconduct warrants an investigation.</p>

<p><i>Investigation</i> means the formal examination and evaluation of the relevant facts.</p>

<p><i>Plagiarism</i> means the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.</p>

<p><i>Research</i> means all basic, applied, and demonstration research in all fields of science, medicine, engineering, and mathematics, including, but not limited to, research in economics, education, linguistics, medicine, psychology, social sciences statistics, and research involving human subjects or animals.</p>

<p><i>Research misconduct</i> means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.</p>

<p><i>Research record</i> means the record of all data or results that embody the facts resulting from scientists' inquiries, including, but not limited to, research proposals, laboratory records, both physical and electronic, progress reports, abstracts, theses, oral presentations, internal reports, and journal articles.</p>

<p>(g) By executing this contract, the Contractor provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, mediating if possible, or investigating, and reporting allegations of research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process and the requirements of 10 CFR part 733 for performing an inquiry, possible mediation, investigation and reporting of research misconduct.</p>

<p>Insert the following clause in accordance with section 950.7006:</p>

<p><b>Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement (AUG 2016)</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>Authority.</i> This clause is incorporated into this contract pursuant to the authority contained in subsection 170d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (hereinafter called the Act.)</p>

<p>(b) <i>Definitions.</i> The definitions set out in the Act shall apply to this clause.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Financial protection.</i> Except as hereafter permitted or required in writing by DOE, the Contractor will not be required to provide or maintain, and will not provide or maintain at Government expense, any form of financial protection to cover public liability, as described in paragraph (d)(2) below. DOE may, however, at any time require in writing that the Contractor provide and maintain financial protection of such a type and in such amount as DOE shall determine to be appropriate to cover such public liability, provided that the costs of such financial protection are reimbursed to the Contractor by DOE.</p>

<p>(d)(1) <i>Indemnification.</i> To the extent that the Contractor and other persons indemnified are not compensated by any financial protection permitted or required by DOE, DOE will indemnify the Contractor and other persons indemnified against (i) claims for public liability as described in subparagraph (d)(2) of this clause; and (ii) such legal costs of the Contractor and other persons indemnified as are approved by DOE, provided that DOE's liability, including such legal costs, shall not exceed the amount set forth in section 170e.(1)(B) of the Act in the aggregate for each nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation occurring within the United States or $500 million in the aggregate for each nuclear incident occurring outside the United States, irrespective of the number of persons indemnified in connection with this contract.</p>

<p>(2) The public liability referred to in subparagraph (d)(1) of this clause is public liability as defined in the Act which (i) arises out of or in connection with the activities under this contract, including transportation; and (ii) arises out of or results from a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation, as those terms are defined in the Act.</p>

<p>(e)(1) <i>Waiver of defenses.</i> In the event of a nuclear incident, as defined in the Act, arising out of nuclear waste activities, as defined in the Act, the Contractor, on behalf of itself and other persons indemnified, agrees to waive any issue or defense as to charitable or governmental immunity.</p>

<p>(2) In the event of an extraordinary nuclear occurrence which—</p>

<p>(i) Arises out of, results from, or occurs in the course of the construction, possession, or operation of a production or utilization facility; or</p>

<p>(ii) Arises out of, results from, or occurs in the course of transportation of source material, by-product material, or special nuclear material to or from a production or utilization facility; or</p>

<p>(iii) Arises out of or results from the possession, operation, or use by the Contractor or a subcontractor of a device utilizing special nuclear material or by-product material, during the course of the contract activity; or</p>

<p>(iv) Arises out of, results from, or occurs in the course of nuclear waste activities, the Contractor, on behalf of itself and other persons indemnified, agrees to waive—</p>

<p>(A) Any issue or defense as to the conduct of the claimant (including the conduct of persons through whom the claimant derives its cause of action) or fault of persons indemnified, including, but not limited to—</p>

<p>(<i>1</i>) Negligence;</p>

<p>(<i>2</i>) Contributory negligence;</p>

<p>(<i>3</i>) Assumption of risk; or</p>

<p>(<i>4</i>) Unforeseeable intervening causes, whether involving the conduct of a third person or an act of God;</p>

<p>(B) Any issue or defense as to charitable or governmental immunity; and</p>

<p>(C) Any issue or defense based on any statute of limitations, if suit is instituted within 3 years from the date on which the claimant first knew, or reasonably could have known, of his injury or change and the cause thereof. The waiver of any such issue or defense shall be effective regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action. The waiver shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with its terms by the claimant against the person indemnified.</p>

<p>(v) The term <i>extraordinary nuclear occurrence</i> means an event which DOE has determined to be an extraordinary nuclear occurrence as defined in the Act. A determination of whether or not there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence will be made in accordance with the procedures in 10 CFR part 840.</p>

<p>(vi) For the purposes of that determination, <i>offsite</i> as that term is used in 10 CFR part 840 means away from “the contract location” which phrase means any DOE facility, installation, or site at which contractual activity under this contract is being carried on, and any contractor-owned or controlled facility, installation, or site at which the Contractor is engaged in the performance of contractual activity under this contract.</p>

<p>(3) The waivers set forth above—</p>

<p>(i) Shall be effective regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action;</p>

<p>(ii) Shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with its terms by the claimant against the person indemnified;</p>

<p>(iii) Shall not preclude a defense based upon a failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages;</p>

<p>(iv) Shall not apply to injury or damage to a claimant or to a claimant's property which is intentionally sustained by the claimant or which results from a nuclear incident intentionally and wrongfully caused by the claimant;</p>

<p>(v) Shall not apply to injury to a claimant who is employed at the site of and in connection with the activity where the extraordinary nuclear occurrence takes place, if benefits therefor are either payable or required to be provided under any workmen's compensation or occupational disease law;</p>

<p>(vi) Shall not apply to any claim resulting from a nuclear incident occurring outside the United States;</p>

<p>(vii) Shall be effective only with respect to those obligations set forth in this clause and in insurance policies, contracts or other proof of financial protection; and</p>

<p>(viii) Shall not apply to, or prejudice the prosecution or defense of, any claim or portion of claim which is not within the protection afforded under (A) the limit of liability provisions under subsection 170e. of the Act, and (B) the terms of this agreement and the terms of insurance policies, contracts, or other proof of financial protection.</p>

<p>(f) <i>Notification and litigation of claims.</i> The Contractor shall give immediate written notice to DOE of any known action or claim filed or made against the Contractor or other person indemnified for public liability as defined in paragraph (d)(2). Except as otherwise directed by DOE, the Contractor shall furnish promptly to DOE, copies of all pertinent papers received by the Contractor or filed with respect to such actions or claims. DOE shall have the right to, and may collaborate with, the Contractor and any other person indemnified in the settlement or defense of any action or claim and shall have the right to (1) require the prior approval of DOE for the payment of any claim that DOE may be required to indemnify hereunder; and (2) appear through the Attorney General on behalf of the Contractor or other person indemnified in any action brought upon any claim that DOE may be required to indemnify hereunder, take charge of such action, and settle or defend any such action. If the settlement or defense of any such action or claim is undertaken by DOE, the Contractor or other person indemnified shall furnish all reasonable assistance in effecting a settlement or asserting a defense.</p>

<p>(g) <i>Continuity of DOE obligations.</i> The obligations of DOE under this clause shall not be affected by any failure on the part of the Contractor to fulfill its obligation under this contract and shall be unaffected by the death, disability, or termination of existence of the Contractor, or by the completion, termination or expiration of this contract.</p>

<p>(h) <i>Effect of other clauses.</i> The provisions of this clause shall not be limited in any way by, and shall be interpreted without reference to, any other clause of this contract, including the clause entitled Contract Disputes, provided, however, that this clause shall be subject to the clauses entitled Covenant Against Contingent Fees, and Accounts, records, and inspection, and any provisions that are later added to this contract as required by applicable Federal law, including statutes, executive orders and regulations, to be included in Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreements.</p>

<p>(i) <i>Civil penalties.</i> The Contractor and its subcontractors and suppliers who are indemnified under the provisions of this clause are subject to civil penalties, pursuant to 234A of the Act, for violations of applicable DOE nuclear-safety related rules, regulations, or orders.</p>

<p>(j) <i>Criminal penalties.</i> Any individual director, officer, or employee of the Contractor or of its subcontractors and suppliers who are indemnified under the provisions of this clause are subject to criminal penalties, pursuant to 223(c) of the Act, for knowing and willful violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and applicable DOE nuclear safety-related rules, regulations or orders which violation results in, or, if undetected, would have resulted in a nuclear incident.</p>

<p>(k) <i>Inclusion in subcontracts.</i> The Contractor shall insert this clause in any subcontract which may involve the risk of public liability, as that term is defined in the Act and further described in paragraph (d)(2) above. However, this clause shall not be included in subcontracts in which the subcontractor is subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) financial protection requirements under section 170b. of the Act or NRC agreements of indemnification under section 170c. or k. of the Act for the activities under the subcontract.</p>
