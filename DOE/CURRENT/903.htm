<p>10 CFR part 708 is applicable to complaints of retaliation filed by employees of contractors, and subcontractors, performing work on behalf of DOE directly related to DOE-owned or leased facilities, if the complaint stems from a disclosure, participation, or refusal described in 10 CFR 708.5.</p>

<p>(b) 10 CFR part 708 provides that for the purposes of the Contract Disputes Act <i>(41 U.S.C. 605</i> and 606), a final decision issued pursuant to 10 CFR part 708 shall not be considered to be a claim by the Government against a contractor or a decision by the contracting officer subject to appeal. However, a contractor's disagreement and refusal to comply with a final decision could result in a contracting officer's decision to disallow certain costs or to terminate the contract for default. In such case, the contractor could file a claim under the Disputes clause of the contract regarding the disallowance of cost or the termination of the contract.</p>
