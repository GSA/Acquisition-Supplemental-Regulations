<p><a name="P18_437"></a><b>Subpart 951.1 — Contractor Use of Government Supply Sources</b></p>

<p><a name="P20_498"></a><b>951.101 Policy. </b></p>

<p>(a) It is Department of Energy (DOE) policy that contractors performing under cost-reimbursement contracts should meet their requirements from Government sources of supply when these sources are available to them, and if it is economically advantageous or otherwise in the best interest of the Government. </p>

<p>[49 FR 12042, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 74 FR 36368, July 22, 2009]</p>

<p><a name="P26_890"></a><b>951.102 Authorization to use Government supply sources. </b></p>

<p>(a) The Head of the Contracting Activity may authorize contractors performing under cost-reimbursement contracts and subcontractors performing under cost-reimbursement subcontracts, where all higher tier contracts and subcontracts are cost-type, to use Government supply sources in accordance with the requirements and procedures in 48 CFR part 51, DOE PMR 41 CFR 109, and any necessary approval from the agency involved. This authority may be redelegated to the level of contracting officer. Direct acquisition by the DOE, rather than by a contractor under cost-reimbursement contracts, shall be required where deemed necessary by the Head of the Contracting Activity in order to carry out special requirements of appropriation acts or other applicable laws relating to particular items. </p>

<p>(c)(1) The DOE central point of contact for the assignment, correction, or deletion of FEDSTRIP activity address codes is the Office of Resource Management, within the Headquarters procurement organization.</p>

<p>(e)(4) Materials, supplies, and equipment acquired from Government sources of supply under the procedures described herein must be used exclusively in connection with Government work, except as otherwise authorized by the Head of the Contracting Activity.</p>

<p>[49 FR 12042, Mar. 28, 1984; 49 FR 38951, Oct. 2, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9108, Feb. 25, 1994; 74 FR 36368, July 22, 2009; 75 FR 29458, 29459, May 26, 2010]</p>

<p><a name="P36_2354"></a><b>951.103 Ordering from Government supply sources. </b></p>

<p>(b) The Senior Procurement Executive shall be informed of instances in which GSA sources of supply are not used because of the quality of the items available from GSA or when a Federal Supply Schedule contractor refuses to honor an order. </p>

<p> [49 FR 12042, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 74 FR 36378, July 22, 2009]</p>

<p><a name="P42_2713"></a><b>Subpart 951.70 — Contractor Employee Travel Discounts </b></p>

<p><a name="P44_2769"></a><b>951.7002 Responsibilities. </b></p>

<p>The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.251-70, Contractor employee travel discounts, in all cost-reimbursable solicitations and contracts when significant costs for rail travel, car rental, or lodging will be required to perform the contract. The contracting officer may furnish the contractor with appropriate identification letters.</p>
