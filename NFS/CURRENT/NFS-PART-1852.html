</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) NASA Electronic Information is any data (as defined in the Rights in Data clause of this contract) or information (including information incidental to contract administration, such as financial, administrative, cost or pricing, or management information) that is processed, managed, accessed or stored on an IT system(s) in the performance of a NASA contract.
</p>

The IT Security Plan is specific to the IT System and not the contract. Within 30 days after award, the contractor shall develop and deliver an IT Security Management Plan to the Contracting Officer; the approval authority will be included in the ADL. All contractor personnel requiring physical or logical access to NASA IT resources must complete NASA's annual IT Security Awareness training.

Access shall be provided to the extent required to carry out a program of IT inspection (to include vulnerability testing), investigation and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of NASA Electronic Information or to the function of IT systems operated on behalf of NASA, and to preserve evidence of computer crime.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(e) At the completion of the contract, the contractor shall return all NASA information and IT resources provided to the contractor during the performance of the contract in accordance with retention documentation available in the ADL. The contractor shall provide a listing of all NASA Electronic information and IT resources generated in performance of the contract. At that time, the contractor shall request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer will provide disposition instructions within 30 calendar days of the contractor's request. Parts of the clause and referenced ADL may be waived by the contracting officer, if the contractor's ongoing IT security program meets or exceeds the requirements of NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 2810.1 in effect at time of award. The current version of NPR 2810.1 is referenced in the ADL. The contractor shall submit a written waiver request to the Contracting Officer within 30 days of award. The waiver request will be reviewed by the Center IT Security Manager. If approved, the Contractor Officer will notify the contractor, by contract modification, which parts of the clause or provisions of the ADL are waived.

The latter clause also may be used with its Alternates II and/or III to obtain delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software, marked with limited rights or restricted rights notices, as appropriate.

                                    <p class="p List1">(e) At the end of each year in the Mentor-Protégé Program, the mentor and protégé, as appropriate, will formally brief the NASA Mentor-Protégé program manager, the technical program manager, and the contracting officer during a formal program review regarding Program accomplishments, as it pertains to the approved agreement.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(f) NASA may terminate mentor-protégé agreements for good cause, thereby excluding mentors or protégés from participating in the NASA Mentor-Protégé program. These actions shall be approved by the NASA OSBP. NASA shall terminate an agreement by delivering to the contractor a letter specifying the reason for termination and the effective date. Termination of an agreement does not constitute a termination of the subcontract between the mentor and the protégé. A plan for accomplishing the subcontract effort should the agreement be terminated shall be submitted with the agreement.</p>

                                    <p class="p List1">(e) The requirements of this clause shall take precedence over any state or local Government laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, standards, or orders that are inconsistent with the requirements of this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(f) For any collective bargaining agreement, the Contractor will negotiate the terms of its program with employee representatives, as appropriate, under labor relations laws or negotiated agreements. Such negotiation, however, cannot change the requirements of this clause. Employees covered under collective bargaining agreements will not be subject to the requirements of this clause until those agreements have been modified, as necessary; provided, however, that if one year after commencement of negotiation the parties have failed to reach agreement, an impasse will be determined to have been reached and the Contractor will unilaterally implement the requirements of this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(g) The Contractor shall insert a clause containing all the terms of this clause, including this paragraph (g), in all subcontracts in which work is performed by an employee in a sensitive position, except subcontracts for commercial items (see FAR parts 2 and 12).</p>

                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Before revoking or modifying the Contractor's license, the Contractor will be provided a written notice of the Administrator's intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by the Administrator for good cause shown) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal to the Administrator any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(e) Contractor's obligations.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to assure that reportable items are promptly identified and disclosed to Contractor personnel responsible for the administration of this New Technology - Other Than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization clause within six months of conception and/or first actual reduction to practice, whichever occurs first in the performance of work under this contract. These procedures shall include the maintenance of laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as are reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual reduction to practice of the reportable items, and records that show that the procedures for identifying and disclosing reportable items are followed. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a description of such procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their effectiveness.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor shall disclose in writing each reportable item to the Contracting Officer within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for the administration of this New Technology - Other Than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization clause or within six months after the Contractor becomes aware that a reportable item has been made, whichever is earlier, but in any event for subject inventions before any on sale, public use, or publication of such invention known to the Contractor. The disclosure to the agency shall identify the inventor(s) or innovator(s) and this contract under which the reportable item was made. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding, to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and physical, chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the reportable item. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, sale or offer for sale, or public use of any subject invention and whether a manuscript describing such invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to the agency, the Contractor will promptly notify the agency of the acceptance of any manuscript describing a subject invention for publication or of any sale, offer for sale, or public use planned by the Contractor for such invention.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) The Contractor may use whatever format is convenient to disclose reportable items required in subparagraph (e)(2). NASA prefers that the Contractor use either the electronic or paper version of NASA Form 1679, Disclosure of Invention and New Technology (including computer software) to disclose reportable items. Both the electronic and paper versions of NASA Form 1679 may be accessed at the electronic New Technology Reporting Web site <em class="ph i">http://invention.nasa.gov.</em>

                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) A final new technology summary report, within 3 months after completion of the contracted work, listing all reportable items or certifying that there were no such reportable items, and listing all subcontracts at any tier containing a patent rights clause or certifying that there were no such subcontracts.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(5) The Contractor agrees, upon written request of the Contracting Officer, to furnish additional technical and other information available to the Contractor as is necessary for the preparation of a patent application on a subject invention and for the prosecution of the patent application, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(6) The Contractor agrees, subject to paragraph 27.302(j) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), that the Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(f) Examination of records relating to inventions.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) Any such inventions are subject inventions;
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) The Contractor has established and maintained the procedures required by paragraph (e)(1) of this clause; and
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the procedures.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor invention that the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject invention, the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to disclose the invention to the agency for a determination of ownership rights.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Any examination of records under this paragraph will be subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(g) Withholding of payment (this paragraph does not apply to subcontracts).
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) Any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount of this contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to - 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for identifying and disclosing reportable items pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this clause;
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) Disclose any reportable items pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this clause;

</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other information required by this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Final payment under this contract shall not be made before the Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer all disclosures of reportable items required by paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, and an acceptable final new technology summary report pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums withheld up to the maximum authorized above. No amount shall be withheld under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government rights.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(h) Subcontracts.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall -

</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to accept such a clause the Contractor -

</p>
                                    <p class="p HD1">Requests for Waiver of Rights to Inventions (APR 2015)
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) In accordance with Section 20135(g) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. 20135(g)) (hereinafter “the Act”) and the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, NASA may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions made or that may be made under a NASA contract or subcontract with other than a small business firm or a domestic nonprofit organization if the Administrator determines that the interests of the United States will be served thereby. Waiver of rights in inventions made or that may be made under such NASA contract or subcontract may be requested at different time periods. Advance waiver of rights to any invention or class of inventions that may be made under a contract or subcontract may be requested prior to the execution of the contract or subcontract, or within 30 days after execution by the selected contractor (or such longer period as may be specified by the Contracting Officer). In addition, waiver of rights to an individually identified invention or to a class of inventions made and reported under a contract or subcontract may be requested, even though a request for an advance waiver was not made or, if made, was not granted.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(b) Each request for waiver of rights shall be by petition to the Administrator. No specific forms need be used, but the request should contain a positive statement that waiver of rights is being requested under the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations; a clear indication of whether the request is for an advance waiver or for a waiver of rights for an individually identified invention or class of inventions; whether foreign rights are also requested and, if so, the countries, and a citation of the specific section or sections of the regulations under which such rights are requested. For individually identified inventions or a class of inventions, the petition shall identify each invention with particularity (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> by NASA's assigned number to the Disclosure of Invention and New Technology report or by title and inventorship). For advance waivers, the petition shall identify the invention or class of inventions that the Contractor believes will be made under the contract and for which waiver is being requested. To meet the statutory standard of “any invention or class of inventions,” the petition must be directed to a single invention or to inventions directed to a particular process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or to a narrowly-drawn, focused area of technology. Additionally, each petition shall include an identification of the petitioner; place of business and address; if petitioner is represented by counsel, the name, address and telephone number of the counsel; the name, address, and telephone number of the party with whom to communicate when the request is acted upon; the signature of the petitioner or authorized representative; and the date of signature. In general, waivers are granted in order to provide for the widest practicable dissemination of new technology resulting from NASA programs, and to promote early utilization, expeditious development, and continued availability of this new technology for commercial purposes and the public benefit. Thus, it is preferable that the petition also include a description of the Contractor's plan for commercializing the invention or class of inventions for which waiver is being requested (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> identify specific fields of use).
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(c) Petitions for advance waiver of rights should, preferably, be included with the proposal, or at least in advance of contract negotiations. Petitions for advance waiver, prior to contract execution, shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer. All other petitions shall be submitted to the Patent Representative designated in the contract.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(d) Petitions submitted with proposals selected for negotiation of a contract will be forwarded by the Contracting Officer to the installation Patent Counsel for processing and then to the Inventions and Contributions Board. The Board will consider these petitions and where the Board makes the findings to support the waiver, the Board will recommend to the Administrator that waiver be granted, and will notify the petitioner and the Contracting Officer of the Administrator's determination. The Contracting Officer will be informed by the Board whenever there is insufficient time or information or other reasons to permit a decision to be made without unduly delaying the execution of the contract. In the latter event, the petitioner will be so notified by the Contracting Officer. All other petitions will be processed by installation Patent Counsel and forwarded to the Board. The Board shall notify the petitioner of its action and if waiver is granted, the conditions, reservations, and obligations thereof will be included in the Instrument of Waiver. Whenever the Board notifies a petitioner of a recommendation adverse to, or different from, the waiver requested, the petitioner may request reconsideration under procedures set forth in the Regulations.</p>

The purpose of this clause is to have the Government assume risks that generally entail unusually high insurance premiums and are not covered by the contractor's contents, work-in-process, and similar insurance. Since the definitions in the clause may not cover every situation that should be covered to achieve this purpose, the clause may be modified as follows: If the contract covers helicopters, vertical take-off aircraft, lighter-than-air airships, or other nonconventional types of aircraft, the definition of “aircraft” should be modified to specify that the aircraft has reached a point of manufacture comparable to that specified in the standard definition, which is written for conventional winged aircraft. The definition of “in the open” may be modified to include “hush houses,” test hangars, comparable structures, and other designated areas. In addition, clause paragraph (d)(3) may be modified to provide for Government assumption of risk of transportation by conveyance on streets or highways if the contracting officer determines that this transportation is limited to the vicinity of the contractor's premises and is merely incident to work being performed under the contract.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) Upon receipt of this notice, the Contractor shall act promptly to correct these conditions, regardless of whether it agrees that they are in fact unreasonable. To the extent that the Contracting Officer may later determine that they were not in fact unreasonable, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the contract price to compensate the Contractor for any additional costs incurred in correcting them, and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) An Earned Value Management System (EVMS) that has been determined by the Cognizant Federal Agency to be compliant with the EVMS guidelines specified in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) - 748 Standard, Industry Guidelines for Earned Value Management Systems (current version at the time of award) to manage this contract; and

The Contractor shall follow and implement the approved compliance/validation plan in a timely fashion. The Government will conduct a Compliance Review to assess the contactor's compliance with its plan, and if the Contractor does not follow the approved implementation schedule or correct all resulting system deficiencies identified as a result of the compliance review within a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer may take remedial action, that may include, but is not limited to, a reduction in fee.

The objective of IBRs is for the Government and the Contractor to jointly assess the Contractor's baseline to be used for performance measurement to ensure complete coverage of the statement of work, logical scheduling of the work activities, adequate resourcing, and identification of inherent risks. See the NASA IBR Handbook (<em class="ph i">http://evm.nasa.gov/handbooks.html</em>) for guidance.

This request shall include a top-level projection of cost and/or schedule growth, whether or not performance variances will be retained, and a schedule of implementation for the reprogramming adjustment. The Government will approve or deny the request within 30 calendar days after receipt of the request. Failure of the Government to respond within this 30-day period constitutes approval of the request. Approval of the deviation request does not constitute a change, or the basis for a change, to the negotiated cost or price of this contract, or the estimated cost of any undefinitized contract actions.</p>

			Proposals received in response to a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) will be used only for evaluation purposes. NASA does not allow a proposal, the contents of which are not available without restriction from another source, or any unique ideas submitted in response to an NRA to be used as the basis of a solicitation or in negotiation with other organizations, nor is a pre-award synopsis published for individual proposals.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) A solicited proposal that results in a NASA award becomes part of the record of that transaction and may be available to the public on specific request; however, information or material that NASA and the awardee mutually agree to be of a privileged nature will be held in confidence to the extent permitted by law, including the Freedom of Information Act.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) NRAs contain programmatic information and certain requirements which apply only to proposals prepared in response to that particular announcement. These instructions contain the general proposal preparation information which applies to responses to all NRAs.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) A contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement may be used to accomplish an effort funded in response to an NRA. NASA will determine the appropriate award instrument. Contracts resulting from NRAs are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the NASA FAR Supplement. A grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement resulting from NRAs are subject to policies and procedures outlined in the Guidebook for Proposers Responding to a NASA Funding Announcement, 2 CFR part 1800, 14 CFR part 1274, or other agreement policy. Any proposal from a large business concern that may result in the award of a contract, which exceeds $5,000,000 and has subcontracting possibilities should include a small business subcontracting plan in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

                                    <p class="p P">(Subcontract plans for contract awards below $5,000,000, will be negotiated after selection.)
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">(5) NASA does not have mandatory forms or formats for responses to NRAs; however, it is requested that proposals conform to the guidelines in these instructions. NASA may accept proposals without discussion; hence, proposals should initially be as complete as possible and be submitted on the proposers' most favorable terms.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">(6) To be considered for award, a submission must, at a minimum, present a specific project within the areas delineated by the NRA; contain sufficient technical and cost information to permit a meaningful evaluation; be signed by an official authorized to legally bind the submitting organization; not merely offer to perform standard services or to just provide computer facilities or services; and not significantly duplicate a more specific current or pending NASA solicitation.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(b) NRA-Specific Items. Several proposal submission items appear in the NRA itself: the unique NRA identifier; when to submit proposals; where to send proposals; number of copies required; and sources for more information. Items included in these instructions may be supplemented by the NRA.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(c) The following information is needed to permit consideration in an objective manner. NRAs will generally specify topics for which additional information or greater detail is desirable.

Offerors or quoters should, in order to maximize protection of trade secrets or other information that is confidential or privileged, place the following notice on the title page of the proposal and specify the information subject to the notice by inserting an appropriate identification in the notice. In any event, information contained in proposals will be protected to the extent permitted by law, but NASA assumes no liability for use and disclosure of information not made subject to the notice.
</p>
                                    <p class="p HD1">Notice - Restriction on Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information

It is furnished to the Government in confidence with the understanding that it will not, without permission of the offeror, be used or disclosed other than for evaluation purposes; provided, however, that in the event a contract (or other agreement) is awarded on the basis of this proposal the Government shall have the right to use and disclose this information (data) to the extent provided in the contract (or other agreement). This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use or disclose this information (data) if obtained from another source without restriction.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">(3) <em class="ph i">Abstract.</em> Include a concise (200-300 word if not otherwise specified in the NRA) abstract describing the objective and the method of approach.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P Runin">(4) <em class="ph i">Project description.</em> (i) The main body of the proposal shall be a detailed statement of the work to be undertaken and should include objectives and expected significance; relation to the present state of knowledge; and relation to previous work done on the project and to related work in progress elsewhere. The statement should outline the plan of work, including the broad design of experiments to be undertaken and a description of experimental methods and procedures. The project description should address the evaluation factors in these instructions and any specific factors in the NRA. Any substantial collaboration with individuals not referred to in the budget or use of consultants should be described. Subcontracting significant portions of a research project is discouraged.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(ii) When it is expected that the effort will require more than one year, the proposal should cover the complete project to the extent that it can be reasonably anticipated. Principal emphasis should be on the first year of work, and the description should distinguish clearly between the first year's work and work planned for subsequent years.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">(5) <em class="ph i">Management approach.</em> For large or complex efforts involving interactions among numerous individuals or other organizations, plans for distribution of responsibilities and arrangements for ensuring a coordinated effort should be described.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">(6) <em class="ph i">Personnel.</em> The principal investigator is responsible for supervision of the work and participates in the conduct of the research regardless of whether or not compensated under the award. A short biographical sketch of the principal investigator, a list of principal publications and any exceptional qualifications should be included. Omit social security number and other personal items which do not merit consideration in evaluation of the proposal. Give similar biographical information on other senior professional personnel who will be directly associated with the project. Give the names and titles of any other scientists and technical personnel associated substantially with the project in an advisory capacity. Universities should list the approximate number of students or other assistants, together with information as to their level of academic attainment. Any special industry-university cooperative arrangements should be described.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P Runin">(7) <em class="ph i">Facilities and equipment.</em> (i) Describe available facilities and major items of equipment especially adapted or suited to the proposed project, and any additional major equipment that will be required. Identify any Government-owned facilities, industrial plant equipment, or special tooling that are proposed for use. Include evidence of its availability and the cognizant Government points of contact.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(ii) Before requesting a major item of capital equipment, the proposer should determine if sharing or loan of equipment already within the organization is a feasible alternative. Where such arrangements cannot be made, the proposal should so state. The need for items that typically can be used for research and non-research purposes should be explained.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P Runin">(8) <em class="ph i">Proposed costs (U.S. proposals only).</em> (i) Proposals should contain cost and technical parts in one volume: do not use separate “confidential” salary pages. As applicable, include separate cost estimates for salaries and wages; fringe benefits; equipment; expendable materials and supplies; services; domestic and foreign travel; ADP expenses; publication or page charges; consultants; subcontracts; other miscellaneous identifiable direct costs; and indirect costs. List salaries and wages in appropriate organizational categories (e.g., principal investigator, other scientific and engineering professionals, graduate students, research assistants, and technicians and other non-professional personnel). Estimate all staffing data in terms of staff-months or fractions of full-time.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(ii) Explanatory notes should accompany the cost proposal to provide identification and estimated cost of major capital equipment items to be acquired; purpose and estimated number and lengths of trips planned; basis for indirect cost computation (including date of most recent negotiation and cognizant agency); and clarification of other items in the cost proposal that are not self-evident. List estimated expenses as yearly requirements by major work phases.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(iii) Allowable costs are governed by FAR part 31 and the NASA FAR Supplement part 1831.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(iv) Use of NASA funds - NASA funding may not be used for foreign research efforts at any level, whether as a collaborator or a subcontract. The direct purchase of supplies and/or services, which do not constitute research, from non-U.S. sources by U.S award recipients is permitted. Additionally, in accordance with the National Space Transportation Policy, use of a non-U.S. manufactured launch vehicle is permitted only on a no-exchange-of-funds basis.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">(9) <em class="ph i">Security.</em> Proposals should not contain security classified material. If the research requires access to or may generate security classified information, the submitter will be required to comply with Government security regulations.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">(10) <em class="ph i">Current support.</em> For other current projects being conducted by the principal investigator, provide title of project, sponsoring agency, and ending date.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P Runin">(11) <em class="ph i">Special matters.</em> (i) Include any required statements of environmental impact of the research, human subject or animal care provisions, conflict of interest, or on such other topics as may be required by the nature of the effort and current statutes, executive orders, or other current Government-wide guidelines.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(ii) Identify and discuss risk factors and issues throughout the proposal where they are relevant, and your approach to managing these risks.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(iii) Proposers should include a brief description of the organization, its facilities, and previous work experience in the field of the proposal. Identify the cognizant Government audit agency, inspection agency, and administrative contracting officer, when applicable.
</p>
                                    <p class="p Runin List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Renewal proposals.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Renewal proposals for existing awards will be considered in the same manner as proposals for new endeavors. A renewal proposal should not repeat all of the information that was in the original proposal. The renewal proposal should refer to its predecessor, update the parts that are no longer current, and indicate what elements of the research are expected to be covered during the period for which support is desired. A description of any significant findings since the most recent progress report should be included. The renewal proposal should treat, in reasonable detail, the plans for the next period, contain a cost estimate, and otherwise adhere to these instructions.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) NASA may renew an effort either through amendment of an existing contract or by a new award.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Length.</em> Unless otherwise specified in the NRA, effort should be made to keep proposals as brief as possible, concentrating on substantive material. Few proposals need exceed 15-20 pages. Necessary detailed information, such as reprints, should be included as attachments. A complete set of attachments is necessary for each copy of the proposal. As proposals are not returned, avoid use of “one-of-a-kind” attachments.
</p>
                                    <p class="p Runin List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Joint proposals.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Where multiple organizations are involved, the proposal may be submitted by only one of them. It should clearly describe the role to be played by the other organizations and indicate the legal and managerial arrangements contemplated. In other instances, simultaneous submission of related proposals from each organization might be appropriate, in which case parallel awards would be made.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) Where a project of a cooperative nature with NASA is contemplated, describe the contributions expected from any participating NASA investigator and agency facilities or equipment which may be required. The proposal must be confined only to that which the proposing organization can commit itself. “Joint” proposals which specify the internal arrangements NASA will actually make are not acceptable as a means of establishing an agency commitment.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(g) <em class="ph i">Late proposals.</em> Proposals or proposal modifications received after the latest date specified for receipt may be considered if a significant reduction in cost to the Government is probable or if there are significant technical advantages, as compared with proposals previously received.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(h) <em class="ph i">Withdrawal.</em> Proposals may be withdrawn by the proposer at any time before award. Offerors are requested to notify NASA if the proposal is funded by another organization or of other changed circumstances which dictate termination of evaluation.
</p>
                                    
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			<em class="ph i">Evaluation factors.</em> (1) Unless otherwise specified in the NRA, the principal elements (of approximately equal weight) considered in evaluating a proposal are its relevance to NASA's objectives, intrinsic merit, and cost.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(2) Evaluation of a proposal's relevance to NASA's objectives includes the consideration of the potential contribution of the effort to NASA's mission.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(3) Evaluation of its intrinsic merit includes the consideration of the following factors of equal importance:
</p>
                                    <p class="p List4">(i) Overall scientific or technical merit of the proposal or unique and innovative methods, approaches, or concepts demonstrated by the proposal.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List4">(ii) Offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List4">(iii) The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, or key personnel critical in achieving the proposal objectives.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List4">(iv) Overall standing among similar proposals and/or evaluation against the state-of-the-art.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(4) Evaluation of the cost of a proposed effort may include the realism and reasonableness of the proposed cost and available funds.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(j) <em class="ph i">Evaluation techniques.</em> Selection decisions will be made following peer and/or scientific review of the proposals. Several evaluation techniques are regularly used within NASA. In all cases proposals are subject to scientific review by discipline specialists in the area of the proposal. Some proposals are reviewed entirely in-house, others are evaluated by a combination of in-house and selected external reviewers, while yet others are subject to the full external peer review technique (with due regard for conflict-of-interest and protection of proposal information), such as by mail or through assembled panels. The final decisions are made by a NASA selecting official. A proposal which is scientifically and programmatically meritorious, but not selected for award during its initial review, may be included in subsequent reviews unless the proposer requests otherwise.
</p>
                                    <p class="p Runin List1">(k) <em class="ph i">Selection for award.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			When a proposal is not selected for award, the proposer will be notified. NASA will explain generally why the proposal was not selected. Proposers desiring additional information may contact the selecting official who will arrange a debriefing.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) When a proposal is selected for award, negotiation and award will be handled by the procurement office in the funding installation. The proposal is used as the basis for negotiation. The contracting officer may request certain business data and may forward a model award instrument and other information pertinent to negotiation.
</p>
                                    <p class="p Runin List1">(l) <em class="ph i">Additional guidelines applicable to foreign proposals and proposals including foreign participation.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			NASA welcomes proposals from outside the U.S. However, foreign entities are generally not eligible for funding from NASA. Therefore, unless otherwise noted in the NRA, proposals from foreign entities should not include a cost plan unless the proposal involves collaboration with a U.S. institution, in which case a cost plan for only the participation of the U.S. entity must be included. Proposals from foreign entities and proposals from U.S. entities that include foreign participation must be endorsed by the respective government agency or funding/sponsoring institution in the country from which the foreign entity is proposing. Such endorsement should indicate that the proposal merits careful consideration by NASA, and if the proposal is selected, sufficient funds will be made available to undertake the activity as proposed. 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) All foreign proposals must be typewritten in English and comply with all other submission requirements stated in the NRA. All foreign proposals will undergo the same evaluation and selection process as those originating in the U.S. All proposals must be received before the established closing date. Those received after the closing date will be treated in accordance with paragraph (g) of this provision. Sponsoring foreign government agencies or funding institutions may, in exceptional situations, forward a proposal without endorsement if endorsement is not possible before the announced closing date. In such cases, the NASA sponsoring office should be advised when a decision on endorsement can be expected.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Successful and unsuccessful foreign entities will be contacted directly by the NASA sponsoring office. Copies of these letters will be sent to the foreign sponsor. Should a foreign proposal or a U.S. proposal with foreign participation be selected, NASA's Office of External Relations will arrange with the foreign sponsor for the proposed participation on a no-exchange-of-funds basis, in which NASA and the non-U.S. sponsoring agency or funding institution will each bear the cost of discharging their respective responsibilities.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) Depending on the nature and extent of the proposed cooperation, these arrangements may entail:
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) An exchange of letters between NASA and the foreign sponsor; or 
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(ii) A formal Agency-to-Agency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(m) <em class="ph i">Cancellation of NRA.</em> NASA reserves the right to make no awards under this NRA and to cancel this NRA.
