<p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal" style="hyphens: none;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(a)  PBA is defined </span><span style='color: #000000; font-family: "Times New Roman";'>in FAR 2.101 and discussed in FAR 37.6.  Although FAR Part 37 </span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>addresses services contracts, PBA is not limited to these contracts.  PBA is the preferred way of contracting for all supplies and services at NASA.  Generally, when contract performance risk under a PBA specification can be fairly shifted to the contractor to allow for the operation of objective incentives, a contract type with objectively measurable incentives (e.g., FFP, FPIF, or CPIF) is appropriate.  However, when contractor performance (e.g., cost control, schedule, or quality/technical) is best evaluated subjectively using quantitative measures, a CPAF contract may be used.</span></p>
<p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal" style="hyphens: none;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(b)  A PBA is a completion form of contract (something is accomplished).  Term/level-of-effort, time-and-materials and labor hour contracts should include, when feasible, features that are performance-oriented.  However, those contracts may not be characterized as PBA.</span></p>

Any exception to this requirement shall be approved in writing by the head of the contracting activity.  Performance incentives may be included in supply and service contracts valued under $25 million, acquired under procedures other than Part 12, at the discretion of the contracting officer upon consideration of the guidelines in 1816.402.  Performance incentives, which are objective and measure performance after delivery and acceptance, are separate from other incentives, such as cost or delivery incentives.</span></p>
<p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal" style="-ms-contextualSpacing: true;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(b)  When a performance incentive is used, it shall be structured to be both positive and negative based on performance after acceptance, unless the contract type requires complete contractor liability for product performance (e.g., fixed price).  In this latter case, a negative incentive is not required. In structuring the incentives, the contract shall establish a standard level of performance based on the salient performance requirement.  This standard performance level is normally the contract's target level of performance.  No performance incentive amount is earned at this standard performance level.  Discrete units of measurement based on the same performance parameter shall be identified for performance above and, when a negative incentive is used, below the standard.  Specific incentive amounts shall be associated with each performance level from maximum beneficial performance (maximum positive incentive) to, when a negative incentive is included, minimal beneficial performance or total failure (maximum negative incentive).  The relationship between any given incentive, either positive or negative, and its associated unit of measurement should reflect the value to the Government of that level of performance.  The contractor should not be rewarded for above-standard performance levels that are of no benefit to the Government.</span></p>
<p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal" style="-ms-contextualSpacing: true;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(c)  The final calculation of the performance incentive shall be done when performance, as defined in the contract, ceases or when the maximum positive incentive is reached.  When performance ceases below the standard established in the contract and a negative incentive is included, the Government shall calculate the amount due and the contractor shall pay the Government that amount.  Once performance exceeds the standard, the contractor may request payment of the incentive amount associated with a given level of performance, provided that such payments shall not be more frequent than monthly.  When performance ceases above the standard level of performance, or when the maximum positive incentive is reached, the Government shall calculate the final performance incentive earned and unpaid and promptly remit it to the contractor.</span></p>

Cost control, schedule, and technical performance considerations shall be included as evaluation factors in all CPAF contracts, as applicable.  When explicit evaluation factor weightings are used, cost control shall be no less than 25 percent of the total weighted evaluation factors.  The predominant consideration of the cost control evaluation should be a measurement of the contractor's performance against the negotiated estimated cost of the contract.

A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the Contractor that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any “willful” or “repeat” violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan.</span></p>

<p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(d)  In rare circumstances, contract costs may increase for reasons outside the contractor's control and for which the contractor is not entitled to an equitable adjustment.  One example is a weather-related launch delay on a launch support contract.  The Government shall take such situations into consideration when evaluating contractor cost control.</span></p>
<p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(e)  Emphasis on cost control should be balanced against other performance requirement objectives.  The contractor should not be incentivized to pursue cost control to the point that overall performance is significantly degraded.  For example, incentivizing an underrun that results in direct negative impacts on technical performance, safety, or other critical contract objectives is both undesirable and counterproductive.  Therefore, evaluation of cost control shall conform to the following guidelines:</span></p>
<p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span>(1)  Normally, the contractor should be given an unsatisfactory rating for cost control when there is a significant overrun within its control.  However, the contractor may receive a satisfactory or higher rating for cost control if the overrun is insignificant.  Award fee ratings should decrease sharply as the size of the overrun increases.  In any evaluation of contractor overrun performance, the Government shall consider the reasons for the overrun and assess the extent and effectiveness of the contractor's efforts to control or mitigate the overrun.</span></p>
<p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span>(2)  The contractor should normally be rewarded for an underrun within its control, up to the maximum award fee rating allocated for cost control, provided the adjectival rating for all other award fee evaluation factors is very good or higher (see </span><span style='color: #000000; font-family: "Times New Roman";'>FAR 16.401(e)(iv)).</span></p>
<p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span><span class="role-tab"> </span>(3)  The contractor should be rewarded for meeting the estimated cost of the contract, but not to the maximum rating allocated for cost control, to the degree that the contractor has prudently managed costs while meeting contract requirements.

<p class="role-tabs-36-0 p-Normal"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'><span class="role-tab"> </span>(f)  When an AF arrangement is used in conjunction with another contract type, the award fee’s cost control factor will only apply to a subjective assessment of the contractor’s efforts to control costs and not the actual cost outcome incentivized under the basic contract type (e.g. CPIF, FPIF).</span></p>

During the award fee evaluation, each factor is scored from 0-100 according to the ratings defined in 1816.405-275(b).  The numerical score for each factor is then multiplied by the weighting for that factor to determine the weighted score.  For example, if the technical factor has a weighting of 60 percent and the numerical score for that factor is 80, the weighted technical score is 48 (80 x 60 percent).

In contrast, to become eligible for an award term, the contractor must maintain a level of performance above acceptable as specified in the Award Term Plan (see 1816.405-277(i)).
