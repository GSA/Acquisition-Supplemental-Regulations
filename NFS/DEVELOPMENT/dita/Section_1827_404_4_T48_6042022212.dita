The prohibition on “release to others” does not prohibit release to another Federal Agency for its use or its contractors' use, as long as any such release is consistent with any restrictive markings on the software. Any restrictive markings on the software shall take precedence over the aforementioned release. Any such release to a Federal Agency in accordance with this paragraph shall limit use to the Federal Agency or its contractors for Government purposes only.

         <p outputclass="List3">(i) The contractor has identified an existing commercial computer software product line or proposes a new one and states a positive intention of incorporating identified computer software first produced under the contract into that line, either directly itself or through a licensee;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) The contractor has identified an existing open source software project or proposes a new one and states a positive intention of incorporating identified computer software first produced under the contract into that project, or has been instructed by the Agency to incorporate software first produced under the contract into an open source software project or otherwise release the software as open source software;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iii) The contractor has made, or will be required to make, substantial contributions to the development of the computer software by co-funding or by cost-sharing, or by contributing resources (including but not limited to agreement to provide continuing maintenance and update of the software at no cost for Governmental use); or

         <p outputclass="List3">(iv) The concurrence of the Agency Counsel for Intellectual Property, or designee, is obtained.

The contracting officer may, in consultation with the center patent or intellectual property counsel, so direct the contractor in situations where copyright protection is considered necessary in furtherance of Agency mission objectives, needed to support specific Agency programs, or necessary to meet statutory requirements.
