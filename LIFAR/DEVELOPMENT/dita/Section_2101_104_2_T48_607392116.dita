      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) <i>General.</i> The LIFAR conforms with the arrangement and numbering system prescribed by FAR 1.104 and 1.303. However, when a FAR part or subpart is adequate for use without further OPM implementation or supplementation, there will be no corresponding LIFAR part, subpart, etc. The LIFAR is to be used in conjunction with the FAR and the order for use is:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) FAR;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) LIFAR.
</p>
         <p props="Runin" outputclass="List1">(b) <i>Citation.</i> 
				     </p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			In formal documents, such as legal briefs, citation of Chapter 21 material that has been published in the Federal Register will be to title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) In informal documents, any section of chapter 21 may be identified as “LIFAR” followed by the section number.
