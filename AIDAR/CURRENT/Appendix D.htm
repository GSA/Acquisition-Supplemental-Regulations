<p align="left"><font color="#0000ff"><b><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .http://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/aapds-cibs/cib-99-15. --><a href="http://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/aapds-cibs/cib-99-15"><u>See also CIB 99-15, Resident Hires and Deviations</u></a></b></font></p>

<p align="left">(a) <u>Purpose</u>. This appendix sets forth the authority, policy, and procedures under which USAID contracts with a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien for personal services abroad.</p>

<p align="left">(b) <u>Definitions</u>.</p>

<p align="left">(1) Personal services contract (PSC) means a contract that, by its express terms or as administered, make the contractor personnel appear, in effect, Government employees (see FAR 37.104).</p>

<p align="left">(2) Employer-employee relationship means an employment relationship under a service contract with an individual, which occurs when, as a result of the contract’s terms or the manner of its administration during performance, the contractor</p>

<p align="left">is subject to the relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government officer or employee.</p>

<p align="left">(3) Non-person services contract means a contract under which the personnel rendering the services are not subject either by the contract’s terms or by the manner of its administration, to the supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees.</p>

<p align="left">(4) Independent contractor relationship means a contract relationship in which the contractor is not subject to the supervision and control prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees. Under this relationship, the Government does not normally supervise the performance of the work, control the days of the week or hours of the day in which it is to be performed, or the location of performance.</p>

<p align="left">(5) Resident hire means a U.S. citizen who, at the time of hire as a PSC, resides in the cooperating country as a spouse or dependent of a U.S. citizen employed by a U.S. government agency or under any U.S. government-financed  contract or agreement, or for reasons other than for employment with a U.S. government agency or under any U.S. government-financed  contract or agreement. A U.S. citizen for purposes of this definition also includes persons who at the time of contracting are lawfully admitted permanent residents of the United States.</p>

<p align="left">(6) U.S. resident alien means a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States.</p>

<p align="left">(7) Abroad means outside the United States and its territories and possessions.</p>

<p align="left">(8) USAID direct-hire employees means civilian employees appointed under USAID Handbook 25 procedures or superseding Automated Directive System (ADS) Chapters.</p>

<p align="left">2. <u>Legal Basis</u>.</p>

<p align="left">(a) Section 635(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the “FAA”) provides the Agency’s contracting authority.</p>

<p align="left">(b) Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2396(a)(3)) authorizes the Agency to enter into personal services contracts with individuals for personal services abroad and</p>

<p align="left">provides further that such individuals “* * * shall not be regarded as employees of the U.S. Government for the purpose of any law administered by the Civil Service Commission.” \1\</p>

<p align="left">\1\ The Civil Service Commission is now the Federal Office of Personnel Management.</p>

<p align="left">3. <u>Applicability</u>.</p>

<p align="left">(a) This appendix applies to all personal services contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens to provide assistance abroad under Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA.</p>

<p align="left">(b) This appendix does not apply to:</p>

<p align="left">(1) Non-personal services contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens; such contracts are covered by the basic text of the FAR (48 CFR Chapter 1) and the AIDAR (48 CFR Chapter 7).</p>

<p align="left">(2) Personal services contracts with individual Cooperating Country Nationals (CCNs) or Third Country Nationals (TCNs). Such contracts are covered by Appendix J of this chapter.</p>

<p align="left">(3) Other personal services arrangements covered by USAID Handbook 25--Employment and Promotion or superseding ADS Chapters.</p>

<p align="left">(4) Interagency agreements (e.g., PASAs and RSSAs covered by ADS 306--Interagency Agreements.</p>

<p align="left">(a) <u>General</u>. USAID may finance, with either program or operating expense (OE) funds, the cost of personal services contracts as part of the Agency’s program of foreign assistance by entering into a direct contract with an individual U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien for personal services abroad.</p>

<p align="left">(1) Program funds. Under the authority of Section 635(h) of the FAA, program funds may be obligated for periods up to five years where necessary and appropriate to the accomplishment of the tasks involved.</p>

<p align="left">(2) Operating Expense Funds. Pursuant to USAID budget policy, OE funded salaries and other recurrent cost items may be forward funded for a period of up to three (3) months beyond the fiscal year in which these funds were obligated. Non- recurring cost items may be forward funded for periods not to exceed twenty-four  (24) months where necessary and appropriate to accomplishment of the work.\2\</p>

<p align="left">(b) <u>Limitations on Personal Services Contracts</u>. </p>

<p align="left">(1) Personal services contracts may only be used when adequate supervision is available.</p>

<p align="left">(2) Personal services contracts may be used for commercial activities. Commercial activities provide a product or service which could be obtained from a commercial source. See Attachment A of OMB Circular A-76 for a representative list of such activities.</p>

<p align="left">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of USAID directives, regulations or delegations, U.S. citizen personal services contractors (USPSCs) may be delegated or assigned any authority, duty or responsibility delegable to U.S. citizen direct-hire employees (USDH employees) except that:</p>

<p align="left">a. They may not supervise U.S. direct-hire employees of USAID or other U.S. Government agencies. They may supervise USPSCs and non-U.S. citizen employees.</p>

<p align="left">b. They may not be designated as Contracting Officers or delegated authority to sign obligating or sub-obligating documents.</p>

<p align="left">c. They may represent the agency, except that communications that reflect a final policy, planning or budget decision of the agency must be cleared by a USDH employee.</p>

<p align="left">d. They may participate in personnel selection matters, but may not be delegated authority to make a final decision on personnel selection.</p>

<p align="left">e. Exceptions to the limitations in this paragraph (b)(3) must be approved by the Assistant Administrator for Management (AA/M).</p>

<p align="left">(c) <u>Withholdings and Fringe Benefits</u>. (1) Personal services contractors (PSCs) are Government employees for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the United States Code) and are, therefore, subject to social security (FICA) and Federal income tax (FIT) withholdings. As employees, they are ineligible for the “foreign earned income” exclusion under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).</p>

<p align="left">(2) Personal services contractors are treated on par with other Government employees, except for programs based on any law administered by the Federal Office of Personnel Management (e.g., incentive awards, life insurance, health insurance, and retirement programs covered by 5 CFR Parts 530, 531, 831, 870, 871, and 890).  While PSCs are ineligible to participate in any of these programs, the following fringe benefits are provided as a matter of policy:</p>

<p align="left">(i) The employer’s FICA contribution for retirement purposes.</p>

<p align="left">(ii) A contribution against the actual cost of the PSC’s annual health and life insurance costs. Proof of health and life insurance coverage and its actual cost to the PSC shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is made. (See also paragraph 4(c)(3) of this Appendix.)</p>

<p align="left">(A) The contribution for health insurance shall not exceed 50% of the actual cost to the PSC for his/her annual health insurance, or the maximum</p>

<p align="left">U.S. Government contribution for a direct-hire employee, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management, whichever is less. If the PSC is covered under a spouse’s health insurance plan, where the spouse’s employer pays some or all of the health insurance costs, the cost to the PSC for annual health insurance shall be considered to be zero.</p>

<p align="left">(B) The contribution for life insurance shall be up to 50% of the actual annual costs to the PSC for life insurance, not to exceed $500.00 per year.</p>

<p align="left">(iii) PSCs shall receive the same percentage pay comparability adjustment as U.S. Government employees subject to the availability of funds.</p>

<p align="left">(iv) PSCs shall receive a 3% annual salary increase subject to satisfactory performance documented in their annual written evaluation. Such increase may not exceed 3% without a deviation.  This 3% limitation also applies to extensions of the same service or negotiations for a new contract for the same or similar services unless a deviation has been approved.</p>

<p align="left">(v) PSCs shall receive the following allowances and differentials provided in the State Department’s Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians Foreign Areas) on the same basis as U.S. Government employees (except for U.S. resident hires, see paragraph 4(d) and Section 12, General Provisions, Clause 22, “U.S. Resident Hire Personal Services Contractors”):</p>

<p align="left">(A) Temporary lodging allowance (Section 120),\3\</p>

<p align="left">(B) Living quarters allowance (Section 130),\3\</p>

<p align="left">(C) Post allowance (Section 220),\3\</p>

<p align="left">(D) Supplemental post allowance (Section 230),\3\</p>

<p align="left">\2\ If there is a need, these contracts may be written for 5 years also but funded only as outlined in paragraph 4(a) of this Appendix.</p>

<p align="left">\3\ Mission Directors may authorize per diem in lieu of these allowances.</p>

<p align="left">(E) Separate maintenance allowance (Section 260),\4\</p>

<p align="left">(F) Education allowance (Section 270),\4\</p>

<p align="left">(G) Educational travel (Section 280),\4\</p>

<p align="left">(H) Post differential (Section 500),</p>

<p align="left">(I) Payments during evacuation/authori zed  departure (Section 600), and</p>

<p align="left">(J) Danger pay (Section 650).</p>

<p align="left">(vi) Any allowance or differential that is not expressly stated in paragraph 4(c)(2)(v) is not authorized for any PSC unless a deviation is approved. The only exception is a consumables allowance if authorized for the post under Handbook 22 or superseding ADS Chapter.</p>

<p align="left">(vii) Health room services may be provided in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled “Physical Fitness and Health Room Privileges.”</p>

<p align="left">(viii) PSCs are eligible to receive benefits for injury, disability, or death under the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act since the law is administered by the Department of Labor not the Office of Personnel Management.</p>

<p align="left">(ix) PSCs are eligible to earn four hours of annual leave and four hours of sick leave for each two week period. However, PSCs with previous PSC service (not previous U.S. Government civilian or military service) earn either six hours of annual leave for each two week period if their previous PSC service exceeds 3 years (including 10 hours annual leave for the final pay period of a calendar year), or eight hours of annual leave for each two week period if their previous PSC service exceeds 15 years.</p>

<p align="left">(3) A PSC who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse’s Government health or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under paragraph 4(c)(2)(ii) of this appendix.</p>

<p align="left">(4) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contract (since the Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree) unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas. If coverage overseas is excluded, then eligibility as cited in paragraph 4(c)(3) applies.</p>

<p align="left">(5) Retired U.S. Government employees may be awarded Personal Services Contracts without any reduction in or offset against their Government annuity.</p>

<p align="left">(d) <u>U.S. Resident Hire Personal Services Contractors</u>. U.S. resident-hire PSCs are not eligible for any fringe benefits (except contributions for FICA, health insurance, and life insurance), including differentials and allowances unless such individuals can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that they have received similar benefits and allowances from their immediately previous employer in the cooperating country, or the Mission Director may determine that payment of such benefits would be consistent with the Mission’s policy and practice and would be in the best interests of</p>

<p align="left">the U.S. Government.</p>

<p align="left">(e) <u>Determining Salary for Personal Services Contractors</u>. (1) There are two separate and distinct methods of establishing a salary for personal services contractors. Use of method number 1 is required unless justified and approved as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(ii).</p>

<p align="left">\4\ These allowances are not authorized for short tours (i.e., less than a year).</p>

<p align="left">(i) Method 1: Salaries for Personal Services Contractors shall be established based on the market value in the United States of the position being recruited for. This requires the Contracting Officer in coordination with the Technical Officer to determine the correct market value (a salary range) of the position to be filled. This method is required in establishing salary for all PSCs unless method 2 is  authorized as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(ii). Contract Information Bulletin (CIB) 96- 8 dated February 23, 1996 provides a guide, which contains information concerning Preparation of Scopes of Work, Determination of Salary Class Grade, Salary Class Bench Marks and Salary Class Review. The market value of the position then becomes the basis along with the applicants’ certified salary history on the SF 171, “Personal Qualifications Statement” for salary negotiations by the Contracting Officer. The SF 171 must be retained in the permanent contract file. Any position, which is determined to be above the GS-13 equivalent and exceeds six months in duration must be classified by M/HR/POD. The crucial point is the establishment of a realistic and reasonable market value for a job. The final determination regarding the reasonableness of a salary level rests with the Contracting Officer. Paying salaries using this method avoids “rank in person” salaries, which are in excess of the value of the job being contracted for.</p>

<p align="left">(ii) Method 2: If approved in writing by the Mission Director or the cognizant Assistant Administrator, based on written justification, salary may be negotiated based on the applicant’s current earnings adjusted in accordance with the factors set out in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) (A) through (C). This approval requirement cannot be redelegated. Current earnings must be certified by the contractor on the SF 171, (see paragraph 6(b)(3) of this appendix).  This is guidance for establishing initial salaries, not subsequent increases, for the same contractor performing the same function.</p>

<p align="left">(A) As a rule, up to a 3 percent increase above current earnings may be given. However, a 3 percent increase is awarded only to a PSC whose earnings are based on a period of twelve months or more; 2 percent for established earnings of less than twelve months but not less than four months; or 1 percent for established earnings during the past four months.</p>

<p align="left">(B) Additional percentages may be given for the following factors. If a PSC has worked in a developing country for more than two years, an additional 1 percent may be awarded. Education related to the area of specialization and above the minimum qualification required may warrant an additional 1 percent, and those specialties for which there is keen competition in the employment market or a serious shortage category nationwide may be awarded an additional 2 percent. In addition, related technical experience over 5 years may increase the percentage by 1 and over ten years by 3.</p>

<p align="left">(C) All requests for an initial rate of pay above 10 percent over current earnings must be approved in writing by the appropriate Assistant Administrator or Mission Director. Current earnings are actual earnings for work reasonably related to the position for which the applicant is being considered. Paragraphs 4(e)(1)(ii) (A) through (C) apply only to salary setting method number 2 in paragraph 4 (e)(1)(ii).</p>

<p align="left">(2) When an applicant has no current earnings history (e.g., a person returning to the workforce after an absence of a number of years) or when an applicant’s current earnings history doesn’t accurately reflect the applicant’s job market worth (e.g., a Peace Corps volunteer), every effort should be made to establish a market value for the position as a basis for negotiation, notwithstanding  the lack of a current earnings history, provided that the applicant has the full qualifications for the job and could command a similar salary in the open job market.</p>

<p align="left">(3) This Appendix applies the “USAID Contractor Salary Threshold (USAID CST)” policy in Automated Directives System (ADS) Chapter 302.3.6.8 to salaries for U.S. PSCs. Salaries in excess of the USAID CST, which is equivalent to the maximum rate for Federal agencies without a certified SES performance appraisal system, must be approved by the M/OAA Director in accordance with the approval procedures in ADS 302.3.6.8(e).  This approval cannot be re-delegated.</p>

<p align="left">(f) <u>Incentive Awards</u>. U.S. PSCs are not eligible to receive monetary awards. They are eligible for non-monetary awards such as certificates.</p>

<p align="left">(g) <u>Annual Salary Increase</u>. PSC contracts written for more than one year should provide for a 3% annual increase based on satisfactory performance documented in their annual written evaluations.</p>

<p align="left">(h) <u>Pay Comparability Adjustment</u>. PSCs shall receive the same percentage pay comparability adjustment as that received by U.S. Government employees subject to the availability of funds.</p>

<p align="left">(i) <u>Subcontracting</u>. PSCs are U.S. Government employees and may not be called upon (or permitted) to subcontract out any part of their work. Funds for subcontracting have no place in the budget of a personal services contract. Support services, equipment, and supplies (e.g., typing and report preparation, paper, pens, computers, and furniture) should be furnished to PSCs just as they would be to direct-hire employees. To the extent that direct-hire personnel may be authorized to purchase supporting services or supplies under a travel authorization, so may PSCs; otherwise, contracts for personal services should not contain any funds for procurement.</p>

<p align="left">(a) <u>Technical Officer’s Responsibilities</u>. The Technical Officer will prepare a written detailed statement of duties and a statement of minimum qualifications to cover the position being recruited for. The statement shall be included in the procurement request (the Acquisition &amp;amp; Assistance Request Document) e.g., the request shall also include the following additional information as a minimum:</p>

<p align="left">(1) The specific foreign location(s) where the work is to be performed, including any travel requirements (with an estimate of frequency);</p>

<p align="left">(2) The length of the contract, with beginning and ending dates, plus any options for renewal or extension;</p>

<p align="left">(3) The basic education, training, experience, and skills required for the position;</p>

<p align="left">(4) An estimate of what a comparable GS/FS equivalent position should cost, including basic salary, allowances, and differentials, if appropriate; and</p>

<p align="left">(5) A list of Government or host country furnished items (e.g., housing).</p>

<p align="left"><u>(b) Contracting Officer’s Responsibilities. </u>(1) The Contracting Officer will prepare the solicitation for personal services, which shall contain:</p>

<p align="left">(i) Three sets of SF 171s and SF 171As. (Upon receipt, one copy of each SF 171 and SF 171A shall be forwarded to the Project Officer.)</p>

<p align="left">(ii) A detailed statement of duties or a completed position description for the position being recruited for.</p>

<p align="left">(iii) A copy of the prescribed contract Cover Page, Contract Schedule, General Provisions as appropriate, as well as the FAR Clauses to be incorporated in full text and by reference.</p>

<p align="left">(iv) A copy of the USAID General Notice entitled “Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct”.</p>

<p align="left">(2) The Contracting Officer shall comply with the requirements of (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c) as detailed in paragraph 5(c) except those recruited from the U.S.</p>

<p align="left">(c) <u>Competition</u>. (1) Under (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1), Personal Services Contracts (except those recruited from the U.S.)</p>

<p align="left">are exempt from the requirements for full and open competition with two limitations that must be observed by Contracting Officers:</p>

<p align="left">(i) Offers are to be requested from as many potential offerors as is practicable under the circumstances, and</p>

<p align="left">(ii) A justification supporting less than full and open competition must be prepared in accordance with FAR 6.303.</p>

<p align="left">(2) PSCs With Untied States Citizens or Resident Aliens Recruited from Outside the Cooperating Country. Solicitations for PSCs recruited outside the cooperating country must be publicized via the Agency’s External Home Page on the Internet under the caption “Business &amp; Procurement, USAID Procurements.” Instructions  regarding how to access the External Internet and the information to be provided have been approved and included in a CIB. A justification under FAR 6.303 is not required when this procedure is followed.</p>

<p align="left">(3) A class justification was approved by the USAID Procurement Executive to satisfy the requirements of (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2) for a justification in accordance with FAR 6.303. This</p>

<p align="left">class justification for Personal Services Contracts with U.S. Citizens may only be used for those who are recruited locally subject to the following conditions:</p>

<p align="left">(i) The position was publicized locally in accordance with established Mission policy or procedure, or the procedures in paragraph 5(c)(ii) was followed;</p>

<p align="left">(ii) As an alternative to the procedures in paragraphs 5(c) (i) and  (ii), at least 3 individuals were considered by consulting source lists (e.g., applications or resumes on hand) or conducting other informal solicitation.</p>

<p align="left">(iii) Extensions or renewals with the same individual for continuing services do not need to be publicized.</p>

<p align="left">(iv) A copy of the class justification (which was distributed to all USAID Contracting Officers via Contract Information Bulletin) must be included in the contract file, together with a written statement, signed by the Contracting Officer, that the contract is being awarded pursuant to (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1); that the conditions for use of this class justification have been met; and that the cost of the contract is fair and reasonable.</p>

<p align="left">(4) If the appropriate competitive procedure in paragraph 5(3) is not followed, the Contracting Officer must prepare a separate justification as required under (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2).</p>

<p align="left">(5) Since the award of a Personal Services Contract is based on technical qualifications, not price, and since the SF 171, “Personal Qualifications Statement”, and SF 171A, “Continuation Sheet for Standard Form 171”, are used to solicit for such contracts, FAR subparts 15.4 and 15.5 and FAR parts 52 and 53 are inappropriate and shall not be used. Instead, the solicitation and selection procedures outlined in this Appendix shall govern.</p>

<p align="left">Negotiating a Personal Services Contract is significantly different from negotiating a non-personal services contract because it establishes an employer-employee relationship; therefore, the selection procedures are more akin to the personnel selection procedures.</p>

<p align="left">(a) <u>Technical Officer’s Responsibilities</u>. The Technical Officer shall be responsible for reviewing and evaluating the applications (i.e., SF 171s) received in response to the solicitation issued by the Contracting Officer. If deemed appropriate, interviews may be conducted with the applicants before the final selection is submitted to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p align="left">(b) <u>Contracting Officer’s Responsibilities</u>. (1) The Contracting Officer shall forward a copy of each SF 171 received under the solicitation to the Project Officer for evaluation.</p>

<p align="left">(2) On receipt of the Technical Officer’s recommendation, the Contracting Officer shall conduct negotiations with the recommended applicant. Normally, the Contracting Officer shall negotiate only the salary (see the salary setting coverage in paragraph 4(e) of this Appendix). The terms and conditions of the contract, including differentials and allowances, are not negotiable or waivable without a properly approved deviation (see (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470). If the Contracting Officer can negotiate a salary that is fair and reasonable, then the award shall be made.</p>

<p align="left">(3) The Contracting Officer shall use the certified salary history on the SF 171 as the basis for salary negotiations, along with the market value of the position being recruited for (unless approval not to use market value has been granted under paragraph 4(e)(1)(ii)), and the Technical Officer’s cost estimate.</p>

<p align="left">(4) The Contracting Officer will obtain two copies of IRS Form W-4, “Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate”, from the successful applicant. (Upon receipt, the Contracting Officer will forward one copy of the W-4 to the Office of the Controller.)</p>

<p align="left">(5) Security clearance is required for all U.S. citizens entering into USAID PSCs. The Contracting Officer will obtain four sets of SF 86, “Security Investigation Data for Sensitive Position”, from the successful applicant and forward them to the Office of Security. PSCs may receive a preliminary clearance and be placed under contract prior to receipt of clearance provided the appropriate paper work has been completed, reviewed by IG/SEC/PSI and acknowledged as a “no objection” to the appropriate Mission. See General Provision 24 in section 12 of this Appendix.</p>

<p align="left">(2) The Statement of Duties does not require performance of any function normally reserved for Federal employees (see paragraph 4(b) of this Appendix); and</p>

<p align="left">(3) There is no apparent conflict of interest involved (if the Contracting Officer believes that a conflict of interest may exist, the question should be referred to the cognizant legal counsel);</p>

<p align="left">(e) Selection of the contractor is documented and justified. (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1) provides an exception to the requirement for full and open competition for Personal Services Contracts abroad (see paragraph 5(c) of this Appendix);</p>

If the contract is with a U.S. citizen residing in the cooperating country when hired, contract provisions governing physical fitness and travel/transportation  expenses, and home leave, allowances, and orientation should be suitably modified (see paragraph 4(d) of this Appendix)).  These modifications are not considered deviations subject to (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470. (Justification and explanation of these modifications is to be included in the contract file);</p>

<p align="left">(g) Orientation is arranged in accordance with General Provision 23 in section 12 of this Appendix;</p>

<p align="left">(j) The contract has been signed by the Contracting Office and the contractor, and fully executed copies are properly distributed;</p>

<p align="left">(k) The following clearances, approvals and forms have been obtained, properly completed, and placed in the contract file before the contract is signed by both parties;</p>

<p align="left">(6) Evidence of DAA/HR clearance that the position may be filled by PSC.</p>

<p align="left">(7) The approval for any salary in excess of the “USAID Contractor Salary Threshold (USAID CST)”, which is equivalent to the maximum rate for Federal agencies without a certified SES performance appraisal system, in accordance with approval procedures in ADS 302.3.6.8(e) as required in Section 4.(e)(3);</p>

<p align="left">(8) A copy of the class justification or other appropriate explanation and support required by (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70, if applicable;</p>

<p align="left">(9) Any deviation to the policy or procedures of this appendix, processed and approved under (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470;</p>

<p align="left">(10) A fully executed SF 171, and a copy of the position classification, and approved deviation, if appropriate;</p>

<p align="left">(11) The Memorandum of Negotiation; and</p>

<p align="left">(12) The Contracting Officer’s signed certification that competition requirements have been satisfied as described in paragraph 5(c) of the policy text of this Appendix. The certification shall be a part of the Memorandum of Negotiations.</p>

<p align="left">(l) Funds for the contract are properly obligated to preclude violation of the Anti- Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 1341 (the Contracting Officer ensures that the contract has been properly recorded by the appropriate accounting office prior to its release for the signature of the selected contractor);</p>

<p align="left">(m) The contractor receives and understands the USAID General Notice entitled “Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct” and a copy is attached to each contract as provided for in paragraph (c) of General Provision 1, section 12;</p>

<p align="left">(p) The contractor understands that he/she is an employee of the United States for purposes of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the United States Code). This subjects the employee to withholding for both FICA and Federal Income Tax and precludes the employee from receiving the Federal Earned Income Tax exclusion of 26 U.S.C. Section 911. See Special Note on the Cover Page of USAID Form 1420-36.</p>

<p align="left">(q) The contractor also understands that he/she may commence work prior to the completion of the security clearance. However, until such time as clearance is received, the contractor may not have access to classified or administratively controlled materials. Failure to obtain clearances will constitute cause for termination.</p>

When such post differential is provided to the contractor, it shall be payable beginning on the date of arrival at the post of assignment and continue, including periods away from post on official business, until the close of business on the day of departure from post of assignment enroute to the United States. Sick or vacation leave taken at or away from the post of assignment will not interrupt the continuity of the assignment or require a discontinuance of such post differential payments, provided such leave is not taken within the United States or the territories of the United States. Post differential will not be payable while the employee is away from his/her post of assignment for purposes of home leave. Short-term employees shall be entitled to pose differential beginning with the forty-third (43rd) day at post.</p>

<p align="left"><u>(2) Living Quarters Allowance</u>. Living quarters allowance is an allowance granted to reimburse an employee for substantially all of his/her cost for either temporary or residence quarters whenever Government-owned  or Government-rented quarters are not provided to him/her at his/her post without charge. Such costs are those incurred for temporary lodging (temporary lodging allowance) or one unit of residence quarters (living quarters allowance) and include rent, plus any costs not included therein for heat, light, fuel, gas, electricity and water. The temporary lodging allowance and the living quarters allowance are never both payable to an employee for the same period of time. The contractor will receive living quarters allowance for payment of rent and utilities if such facilities are not supplied. Such allowance shall not exceed the amount paid USAID employees of equivalent rank in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with either the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 130, as from time to time amended, or other rates approved by the Mission Director. Subject to the written approval of the Mission Director, short-term employees may be paid per diem (in lieu of living quarters allowance) at rates prescribed by the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended, during the time such short-term employees spend at posts of duty in the Cooperating Country under this contract. In authorizing such per diem rates, the Mission Director shall consider the particular circumstances involved with respect to each such short-term employee including the extent to which meals and/or lodging may be made available without charge or at nominal cost by an agency of the United States Government or of the Cooperating Government, and similar factors.</p>

<p align="left">(3) <u>Temporary Lodging Allowance</u>. Temporary lodging allowance is a quarters allowance granted to an employee for the reasonable cost of temporary quarters incurred by the employee and his/her family for a period not in excess of (i ) three months after first arrival at a new post in a foreign area or a period ending with the occupation of residence (permanent) quarters, if earlier, and (ii) one month immediately preceding final departure from the post subsequent to the necessary vacating of residence quarters. The contractor will receive temporary lodging allowance for himself/herself and authorized dependents, in lieu of living quarters allowance, not to exceed the amount set forth in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 120, as from time to time amended.</p>

<p align="left">(6) <u>Payments During Evacuation</u>. The Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) provide the authority for efficient, orderly, and equitable procedure for the payment of</p>

<p align="left">compensation, post differential and allowances in the event of an emergency evacuation of employees or their dependents, or both, from duty stations for military or other reasons or because of imminent danger to their lives. If evacuation has been authorized by the Mission Director, the contractor will receive payments during evacuation for himself/herself and authorized dependents evacuated from their post of assignment in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 600, and the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended.</p>

The contractor will receive separate maintenance allowance payments not to exceed that made to USAID employees in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 260, as from time to time amended.</p>

<p align="left">(9) <u>Danger Pay Allowance</u>.

The danger pay allowance is in lieu of that part of the post differential, which is attributable to political violence. Consequently, the post differential may be reduced while danger pay is in effect to avoid dual crediting for political violence. The contractor shall be allowed danger pay allowance not to exceed that paid USAID employees in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 650, as from time to time amended.</p>

<p align="left">(10) <u>Educational Travel</u>.

The advance shall be granted on the same basis as to a USAID U.S.-citizen direct-hire employee in accordance with USAID Handbook 22, Chapter 4 or superseding ADS Chapter.</p>

<p align="left">9. INSURANCE (Apr 1997)</p>

<p align="left">(a) <u>Worker’s Compensation Benefits</u>. The contractor shall be provided worker’s compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act.</p>

The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such case, the contractor would be eligible for contributions under paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) as appropriate.</p>

<p align="left">(4) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.</p>

<p align="left">(5) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse’s Government health or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this provision.</p>

<p align="left">(c) <u>Insurance  on Private Automobiles</u>. If the contractor or his/her dependents transport, or cause to be transported, privately owned automobile(s) to the Cooperating Country, or any of them purchase an automobile within the Cooperating Country, the contractor agrees to ensure that all such automobile(s) during such ownership within the Cooperating Country will be covered by a current, i.e., not in arrears, insurance policy issued by a reliable company providing the following minimum coverage, or such other minimum coverage as may be set by the Mission Director, payable in U.S. dollars or its equivalent in the currency of the Cooperating Country: injury to persons, $10,000/$20,000; property damage, $5,000. The contractor further agrees to deliver, or cause to be delivered to the Mission Director, the insurance policies required by this clause or satisfactory proof of the existence thereof, before such automobile(s) operated within the Cooperating Country.

Such stopover shall not be authorized when travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the traveler or the traveler uses other than economy class. Per diem during such stopover shall be paid in accordance with the Standardized Regulations.</p>

<p align="left">(k) <u>Rest and Recuperation Travel</u>. If approved in writing by the Mission Director, the contractor and his/her dependents shall be allowed rest and recuperation travel on the same basis as authorized USAID direct-hire Mission employees and their dependents.</p>

<p align="left">(l) <u>Transportation of Motor Vehicles, Personal Effects and Household Goods</u>.</p>

<p align="left">(1) Transportation costs will be paid on the same basis as for USAID direct-hire employees serving the same length tour of duty, as authorized in the schedule. Transportation, including packing and crating costs, will be paid for shipping from the point of origin in the United States (or other location as approved by the Contracting Officer) to post of duty in the Cooperating Country and return to point of origin in the United States (or other location as approved by the Contracting Officer) of one privately-owned  vehicle for the contractor, personal effects of the contractor and authorized dependents, and household goods of the contractor not to exceed the limitations in effect for such shipments for USAID direct-hire employees in accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations in effect at the time shipment is made. These limitations may be obtained from the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p align="left">(2) The cost of transporting motor vehicles and household goods shall not exceed the cost of packing, crating, and transportation by surface common carrier. In the event that the carrier does not require boxing or crating of motor vehicles for shipment to the Cooperating Country, the cost of boxing or crating is not reimbursable. The transportation of a privately owned motor vehicle for a contractor may be authorized as a replacement of the last such motor vehicle shipped under this contract for such contractor when the Mission Director determines, in advance, and so notifies the contractor in writing, that the replacement is necessary for reasons not due to the negligence or malfeasance of the contractor. The determination shall be made under the same rules and regulations that apply to authorized Mission U.S. citizen direct-hire employees.</p>

<p align="left">(m) <u>Unaccompanied Baggage</u>. Unaccompanied baggage is considered to be those personal belongings needed by the traveler immediately upon arrival of the contractor and dependents, and consideration should be given to advance shipments of unaccompanied baggage. The contractor will be reimbursed for costs of shipment of unaccompanied baggage (in addition to the weight allowance for household effects) not to exceed the limitations in effect for USAID direct-hire employees in accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations as in effect when shipment is made. These limitations are available from the Contracting Officer. This unaccompanied baggage may be shipped as air freight by the most direct route between authorized points of origin and destination regardless of the modes of travel used. This provision is applicable to home leave travel when authorized by the terms of this contract.</p>

<p align="left">(n) <u>International  Ocean Transportation</u>.</p>

<p align="left">(1)(i) Transportation of things. Where U.S. flag vessels are not available, or their use would result in a significant delay, the contractor may obtain a release from the requirement to use U.S. flag vessels from the Transportation Division, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, U.S. Agency for International Development, Washington, D.C. 20523-1419, or the Mission Director, as appropriate, giving the basis for the request.</p>

<p align="left">(2) Transportation of foreign-made vehicles. Reimbursement of the costs of transporting a foreign-made motor vehicle will be made</p>

<p align="left">in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Service Travel  Regulations.</p>

<p align="left">(3) Reduced rates on U.S.-flag carriers are in effect for shipments of household goods and personal effects of USAID contractors between certain locations. These reduced rates are available provided the shipper furnishes to the carrier at the time of the issuance of the Bill of Lading documentary evidence that the shipment is for the account of USAID. The Contracting Officer will, on request, furnish to the contractor current information concerning the availability of a reduced rate with respect to any proposed shipment. The contractor will not be reimbursed for shipments of household goods or personal effects in amounts in excess of the reduced rates, which are available in accordance with the foregoing.</p>

<p align="left">(o) <u>Storage of household effects</u>. The cost of storage charges (including packing, crating, and drayage costs) in the U.S. of household goods of the contractor will be permitted in lieu of transportation of all or any part of such goods to the Cooperating Country under paragraph (l) above provided that the total amount of effects shipped to the Cooperating Country or stored in the U.S. shall not exceed the amount authorized for USAID direct-hire employees under the Uniform Foreign Service Travel Regulations. These amounts are available from the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p align="left">11. PAYMENT (Aug 1996)</p>

<p align="left">(a) Once each month, or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the paying office indicated on the Cover Page, the contractor may submit to such office form SF 1034 “Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal” (original) and SF 1034-A (three copies), or whatever other form is locally required or accepted.

<p align="left">(d) The Mission Director is the chief representative of USAID in the Cooperating Country. In this capacity, he/she is responsible for the total USAID Program in the Cooperating Country including certain administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract and for advising USAID regarding the performance of the work under the contract and its effect on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program. The contractor will be responsible for performing his/her duties in accordance with the statement of duties called for by the contract.  However, he/she shall be under the general policy guidance of the Mission Director, and shall keep the Mission Director or his/her designated representative currently informed of the progress of the work under this contract.</p>

The determination must be based on findings that the quality of local medical services or other circumstances obviate the need for such coverage for PSCs and their dependents located at post.</p>

<p align="left">26. GOVERNING LAW (Nov 1996)</p>
