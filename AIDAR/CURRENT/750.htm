<p align="left">Source: 49 FR 13257, Apr. 3, 1984, unless otherwise noted. </p>

<p><a name="P3_251"></a><b>750.000   Scope of part.</b></p>

<p align="left">USAID is not among the agencies named in the Act or authorized by the President to take actions under it; however, see Subpart 750.71—Extraordinary Contractual Actions to Protect Foreign Policy Interests of the United States.</p>

<p><a name="P5_502"></a><b>Subpart 750.70 [Reserved]</b></p>

<p><a name="P6_527"></a><b>Subpart 750.71—Extraordinary Contractual Actions To Protect Foreign Policy Interests of the United States</b></p>

<p><a name="P7_634"></a><b>750.7100   Scope of subpart.</b></p>

<p align="left">This subpart sets forth the standards and the procedures for disposition of requests for extraordinary contractual actions under Executive Order 11223.</p>

<p><a name="P9_813"></a><b>750.7101   Authority.</b></p>

<p align="left">Under section 633 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 75 Stat. 454 (22 U.S.C. 2933), as amended; Executive Order 11223, dated May 12, 1965 (30 FR 6635), as amended; and Executive Order 12163, dated September 29, 1979 (44 FR 56673), as amended, the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development has been granted authority to provide extraordinary contractual relief. The Authority is set forth in sections 3 and 4 of Executive Order 11223, as follows:</p>

<p align="left">Section 3. With respect to cost-type contracts heretofore or hereafter made with non-profit institutions under which no fee is charged or paid, amendments or modifications of such contracts may be made with or without consideration and may be utilized to accomplish the same things as any original contract could have accomplished, irrespective of the time or circumstances of the making, or of the form of the contract amended or modified, or of the amending or modifying contract and irrespective of rights which may have accrued under the contract or the amendments or modifications thereof.</p>

<p align="left">Section 4. With respect to contracts heretofore or hereafter made, other than those described in section 3 of this order, amendments and modifications of such contracts may be made with or without consideration and may be utilized to accomplish the same things as any original contract could have accomplished, irrespective of the time or circumstances of the making, or the form of the contract amended or modified, or of the amending or modifying contract, and irrespective of rights which may have accrued under the contract or the amendments or modifications thereof, if the Secretary of State or the Director of the United States International Development Cooperation Agency (with respect to functions vested in or delegated to Director) determines in each case that such action is necessary to protect the foreign policy interests of the United States.</p>

<p align="left">[49 FR 49472, Dec. 20, 1984, as amended at 62 FR 40469, July 29, 1997; 64 FR 42042, Aug. 3, 1999]</p>

<p><a name="P14_2853"></a><b>750.7102   General policy.</b></p>

<p align="left">Extra-contractual claims arising from foreign assistance contracts will be processed in accordance with this subpart, which is similar to that utilized to process claims for extraordinary relief under (48 CFR)<font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR50.doc. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/50.htm#TopOfPage"> FAR part 50</a></u></font>, as modified to meet the circumstances involved under the Foreign Assistance Act and the different authority involved.</p>

<p align="left">[49 FR 13257, Apr. 3, 1984, as amended at 79 FR 74988, Dec. 16, 2014]</p>

<p><a name="P17_3288"></a><b>750.7103   Definitions.</b></p>

<p align="left">(a) The term <i>approving authority</i> as used in this subpart means an officer or official having been delegated authority to approve actions under the Executive Order. This authority is distinguished from authority to take appropriate contractual action pursuant to such approval.</p>

<p align="left">(b) The term <i>the Executive Order</i> shall mean Executive Order 11223 (30 FR 6635) as amended, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p align="left">(c) The term <i>the Act</i> shall mean the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.</p>

<p align="left">[49 FR 13257, Apr. 3, 1984, as amended at 49 FR 49472, Dec. 20, 1984]</p>

<p><a name="P22_3850"></a><b>750.7104   Types of actions.</b></p>

<p align="left">Three types of actions may be taken by or pursuant to the direction of an approving authority under the Executive Order. These are contractual adjustments such as amendments without consideration, correction of mistakes, and formalization of informal commitments.</p>

<p><a name="P24_4141"></a><b>750.7105   Approving authorities.</b></p>

<p align="left">All authority to approve actions under this subpart has been delegated to the M/OAA Director.</p>

<p align="left">[50 FR 16086, Apr. 24, 1985, as amended at 64 FR 42040, Aug. 3, 1999; 72 FR 19670, Apr. 19, 2007]</p>

<p><a name="P27_4364"></a><b>750.7106   Standards for deciding cases.</b></p>

<p><a name="P28_4404"></a><b>750.7106-1   General.</b></p>

<p align="left">The mere fact that losses occur under a Government contract is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for the exercise of the authority conferred by the Executive Order. Whether, in a particular case, appropriate action such as amendment without consideration, correction of a mistake or ambiguity in a contract, or formalization of an informal commitment, will protect the foreign policy interests of the United States is a matter of sound judgment to be made on the basis of all of the facts of such case. Although it is obviously impossible to predict or enumerate all the types of cases with respect to which action may be appropriate, examples of certain cases or types of cases where action may be proper are set forth in sections <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><a href="750.htm#P30_5484">750.7106-</a></u></font>2 through <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><a href="750.htm#P39_7451">750.7106-4</a></u></font>. Even if all of the factors contained in any of the examples are present, other factors or considerations in a particular case may warrant denial of the request. These examples are not intended to exclude other cases where the approving authority determines that the circumstances warrant action.</p>

<p><a name="P30_5484"></a><b>750.7106-2   Amendments without consideration.</b></p>

<p align="left">(a) Where an actual or threatened loss under a foreign assistance contract, however caused, will impair the productive ability of a contractor whose continued performance of any foreign assistance contract or whose continued operation as a source of supply is found to be essential to protect the foreign policy interests of the United States, the contract may be adjusted but only to the extent necessary to avoid such impairment to the contractor's productive ability.</p>

<p align="left">(b) Where a contractor suffers a loss (not merely a diminution of anticipated profits) on a foreign assistance contract as a result of Government action, the character of the Government action will generally determine whether any adjustment in the contract will be made and its extent. Where the Government action is directed primarily at the contractor and is taken by the Government in its capacity as the other contracting party, the contract may be adjusted if fairness so requires; thus where such Government action, although not creating any liability on its part, increases the cost of performance, considerations of fairness may make appropriate some adjustment in the contract.</p>

<p><a name="P33_6686"></a><b>750.7106-3   Mistakes.</b></p>

<p align="left">A contract may be amended or modified to correct or mitigate the effect of a mistake, including the following examples:</p>

<p align="left">(a) A mistake or ambiguity which consists of the failure to express or to express clearly in the written contract the agreements as both parties understood them;</p>

<p align="left">(b) A mistake on the part of the contractor which is so obvious that it was or should have been apparent to the contracting officer; and</p>

<p align="left">(c) A mutual mistake as to a material fact.</p>

<p align="left">Amending contracts to correct mistakes with the least possible delay normally will protect the foreign policy interests of the United States by expediting the procurement program and by giving contractors proper assurance that such mistakes will be corrected expeditiously and fairly.</p>

<p><a name="P39_7451"></a><b>750.7106-4   Informal commitments.</b></p>

<p align="left">Informal commitments may be formalized under certain circumstances to permit payment to persons who have taken action without a formal contract; for example, where any person, pursuant to written or oral instructions from an officer or official of the Agency and relying in good faith upon the apparent authority of the officer or official to issue such instructions, has arranged to furnish or has furnished property or services to the agency and/or to a foreign assistance contractor or subcontractor without formal contractual coverage for such property or services. Formalization of commitments under such circumstances normally will protect the foreign policy interests of the United States by assuring persons that they will be treated fairly and paid expeditiously.</p>

<p><a name="P41_8257"></a><b>750.7107   Limitations upon exercise of authority.</b></p>

<p align="left">(a) The Executive Order is not authority for:</p>

<p align="left">(1) The use of the cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost system of contracting;</p>

<p align="left">(2) The making of any contract in violation of existing law relating to limitation on profit or fees;</p>

<p align="left">(3) The waiver of any bid, payment performance or other bond required by law.</p>

<p align="left">(b) No amendments, or modifications shall be entered into under the authority of the Executive Order:</p>

<p align="left">(1) Unless, with respect to cases falling within Section 4 of the Executive Order, a finding is made that the action is necessary to protect the foreign policy interests of the United States;</p>

<p align="left">(2) Unless other legal authority in the Agency is deemed to be lacking or inadequate;</p>

<p align="left">(3) Except within the limits of the amounts appropriated and the statutory contract authorization.</p>

<p align="left">(c) No contract shall be amended or modified unless the request therefor has been filed before all obligations (including final payment) under the contract have been discharged.</p>

<p align="left">(d) No informal commitment shall be formalized unless:</p>

<p align="left">(1) A request for payment has been filed within six months after arranging to furnish or furnishing property or services in reliance upon the commitment;</p>

<p align="left">(2) USAID has received the services satisfactorily performed, or has accepted property furnished in reliance on the commitment;</p>

<p align="left">(3) The USAID employees alleged to have made the informal commitment have accepted responsibility for making the informal commitment in question; and</p>

<p align="left">(4) USAID has taken appropriate action to prevent recurrence.</p>

<p align="left">[49 FR 13257, Apr. 3, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 16088, Apr. 24, 1985; 53 FR 4982, Feb. 19, 1988]</p>

<p><a name="P57_9894"></a><b>750.7108   Contractual requirements.</b></p>

<p align="left">Every contract amended or modified pursuant to this subpart shall contain:</p>

<p align="left">(a) A citation of the Act and Executive Order.</p>

<p align="left">(b) A brief statement of the circumstances justifying the action;</p>

<p align="left">(c) A recital of the finding, with respect to cases falling within Section 4 of the Executive Order, that the action is necessary to protect the foreign policy interests of the United States.</p>
