<p align="left"><b>Partner Vetting Pre-award Requirements (FEB 2012)</b></p>

<p align="left">(a) USAID has determined that any contract resulting from this solicitation is subject to vetting. Terms used in this provision are defined in paragraph (b) of the (48 CFR) AIDAR clause at <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><a href="752.htm#P103_14756">752.204-71</a></u></font> Partner Vetting, of this solicitation. An offeror that has not passed vetting is ineligible for award.</p>

<p align="left">(b) The following are the vetting procedures for this solicitation:</p>

<p align="left">(1) Prospective offerors review the attached USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, and submit any questions about the USAID Partner Information Form or these procedures to the contracting officer by the deadline for questions in the solicitation.</p>

<p align="left">(2) The contracting officer notifies the offeror when to submit the USAID Partner Information Form. For this solicitation, USAID will vet at [<i>insert in the provision the applicable stage of the source selection process at which the contracting officer will notify the offeror(s) who must be vetted</i>]. Within the timeframe set by the contracting officer in the notification, the offeror must complete and submit the information on the USAID Partner Information Form in accordance with instructions from the vetting official named in paragraph (d) of the (48 CFR) AIDAR clause at <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><a href="752.htm#P103_14756">752.204-71</a></u></font> Partner Vetting, of this solicitation.</p>

<p align="left">Note: Offerors who submit using non-secure methods of transmission do so at their own risk.</p>

<p align="left">(3) The offerors must notify proposed subcontractors of this requirement when the subcontractors are subject to vetting.</p>

<p align="left">(c) Source selection proceeds separately from vetting. Vetting is conducted independently from any discussions the contracting officer may have with an offeror. The offeror and any subcontractor subject to vetting must not provide vetting information to other than the vetting official. The offeror and any subcontractor subject to vetting will communicate only with the vetting official regarding their vetting submission(s) and not with any other USAID or USG personnel, including the contracting officer or his/her representatives. Exchanges between the Government and an offeror about vetting information submitted by the offeror or any proposed subcontractor are clarifications in accordance with (48 CFR) <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR15.doc#b15306. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/15.htm#P286_46346">FAR 15.306</a></u></font>(a) (48 CFR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR15.doc#b15306. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/15.htm#P286_46346">15.306</a></u></font>(a)). The contracting officer designates the vetting official as the only individual authorized to clarify the offeror's and proposed subcontractor's vetting information.</p>

<p align="left">(d)(1) The vetting official notifies the offeror that it:</p>

<p align="left">(i) Has passed vetting,</p>

<p align="left">(ii) Has not passed vetting, or</p>

<p align="left">(iii) Must provide additional information, and resubmit the USAID Partner Information Form with the additional information within the number of days the vetting official specified in the notification.</p>

<p align="left">(2) The vetting official will include in the notification any information that USAID's Office of Security (SEC) determines releasable. In its determination, SEC will take into consideration the classification or sensitivity of the information, the need to protect sources and methods, or status of ongoing law enforcement and intelligence community investigations or operations.</p>

<p align="left">(e) <i>Reconsideration.</i> (1) Within 7 calendar days after the date of the vetting official's notification, an offeror that has not passed vetting may request in writing to the vetting official that the Agency reconsider the vetting determination. The request should include any written explanation, legal documentation and any other relevant written material for reconsideration.</p>

<p align="left">(2) Within 7 calendar days after the vetting official receives the request for reconsideration, the Agency will determine whether the offeror's additional information warrants a revised decision.</p>

<p align="left">(3) The Agency's determination of whether reconsideration is warranted is final.</p>

<p align="left">(f) <i>Revisions to vetting information.</i> (1) Offerors who change key individuals, whether the offeror has previously passed vetting or not, must submit a revised USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official. This includes changes to key personnel resulting from revisions to the technical proposal.</p>

<p align="left">(2) The vetting official will follow the vetting process in paragraph (d) of this clause for any revision of the offeror's Form.</p>

<p align="left">(g) <i>Award.</i> At the time of award, the contracting officer will confirm with the vetting official that the apparently successful offeror has passed vetting. The contracting officer may award only to an apparently successful offeror that has passed vetting.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Partner Vetting in Indefinite Delivery Contracts (FEB 2012)</b></p>

<p align="left">(a) The contractor must comply with the vetting requirements for key individuals under this contract and in any orders that are identified as subject to vetting.</p>

<p align="left">(b) Definitions. As used in this provision—</p>

<p align="left"><i>Key individual</i> means:</p>

<p align="left">(i) Principal officers of the organization's governing body (e.g., chairman, vice chairman, treasurer and secretary of the board of directors or board of trustees);</p>

<p align="left">(ii) The principal officer and deputy principal officer of the organization (e.g., executive director, deputy director, president, vice president);</p>

<p align="left">(iii) The program manager or chief of party for the USG-financed program; and</p>

<p align="left">(iv) Any other person with significant responsibilities for administration of the USG-financed activities or resources, such as key personnel as described in Automated Directives System Chapter 302. Key personnel, whether or not they are employees of the prime contractor, must be vetted.</p>

<p align="left"><i>Vetting official</i> means the USAID employee identified in paragraph (d) of this clause as having responsibility for receiving vetting information, responding to questions about information to be included on the USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, coordinating with the USAID Office of Security, and conveying the vetting determination to each contractor, potential subcontractors subject to vetting, and to the cognizant contracting officer. The vetting official is not part of the contracting office and has no involvement in the source selection process.</p>

<p align="left">(c) The contractor must submit a USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13 to the designated vetting official:</p>

<p align="left">(1) when the contractor replaces key individuals under the basic contract with individuals who have not been previously vetted.</p>

<p align="left">(2) when the contractor replaces key individuals under an order subject to vetting with individuals who have not been previously vetted. For changes to any key individuals associated with both the basic contract and any orders subject to vetting, the contractor must submit updated vetting forms to each designated vetting official. Note: USAID will not approve any key personnel who have not passed vetting.</p>

<p align="left">(d)(1) The designated vetting official for the basic contract is:</p>

<p align="left">Vetting official: </p>

<p align="left"> </p>

<p align="left">Address: </p>

<p align="left"> </p>

<p align="left"> </p>

<p align="left">Email: __________ (for inquiries only)</p>

<p align="left">(2) Each order subject to vetting will identify the vetting official for that order. The contractor must submit vetting information specific to an order to the vetting official identified in that order.</p>

<p align="left">(e)(1) The vetting official will notify the contractor that it—</p>

<p align="left">(i) Has passed vetting,</p>

<p align="left">(ii) Has not passed vetting, or</p>

<p align="left">(iii) Must provide additional information, and resubmit the USAID Partner Information Form with the additional information within the number of days the vetting official specifies.</p>

<p align="left">(2) The vetting official will include in the notification any information that USAID's Office of Security (SEC) determines releasable. In its determination, SEC will take into consideration the classification or sensitivity of the information, the need to protect sources and methods, or status of ongoing law enforcement and intelligence community investigations or operations.</p>

<p align="left">(f) <i>Reconsideration.</i> (1) Within 7 calendar days after the date of the vetting official's notification, the contractor or prospective subcontractor that has not passed vetting may request in writing to the vetting official that the Agency reconsider the vetting determination. The request should include any written explanation, legal documentation and any other relevant written material for reconsideration.</p>

<p align="left">(2) Within 7 calendar days after the vetting official receives the request for reconsideration, the Agency will determine whether the contractor's additional information warrants a revised decision.</p>

<p align="left">(3) The Agency's determination of whether reconsideration is warranted is final.</p>

<p align="left">(g) A notification that the contractor has passed vetting does not constitute any other approval under this contract.</p>

<p align="left">(h) The request for task or delivery order proposals will identify whether the order is subject to vetting. The following are the procedures for vetting orders under this contract. Note that the term “awardee” as used below refers to a contractor under multiple-award indefinite-delivery contracts, consistent with the use of the term in (48 CFR) <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR16.DOC#b16505. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/16.htm#P467_78770">FAR 16.505</a></u></font>(b):</p>

<p align="left">(1) The contracting officer will notify the awardees when to complete and submit the USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official named in the request for order proposals. Note: Awardees who submit using non-secure methods of transmission do so at their own risk.</p>

<p align="left">(2) The awardee must notify proposed subcontractors of this requirement when the subcontractors are subject to vetting.</p>

<p align="left">(3) The fair opportunity process proceeds separately from vetting. Vetting is conducted independently from any discussions the contracting officer may have with an awardee. The awardee and any subcontractor subject to vetting must not provide vetting information to other than the vetting official identified in the request for order proposal. The awardee and any subcontractor subject to vetting will communicate only with the vetting official regarding their vetting submission(s) and not with any other USAID or USG personnel, including the contracting officer or his/her representatives.</p>

<p align="left">(4)(i) The vetting official notifies the awardee that it:</p>

<p align="left">(A) Has passed vetting,</p>

<p align="left">(B) Has not passed vetting, or</p>

<p align="left">(C) Must provide additional information, and resubmit the USAID Partner Information Form with the additional information within the number of days the vetting official specified in the notification.</p>

<p align="left">(ii) The vetting official will include in the notification any information that USAID's Office of Security (SEC) determines releasable. In its determination, SEC will take into consideration the classification or sensitivity of the information, the need to protect sources and methods, or status of ongoing law enforcement and intelligence community investigations or operations.</p>

<p align="left">(5) <i>Reconsideration.</i> (i) Within 7 calendar days after the date of the vetting official's notification, an awardee that has not passed vetting may request in writing to the vetting official that the Agency reconsider the vetting determination. The request should include any written explanation, legal documentation and any other relevant written material for reconsideration.</p>

<p align="left">(ii) Within 7 calendar days after the vetting official receives the request for reconsideration, the Agency will determine whether the contractor's additional information warrants a revised decision.</p>

<p align="left">(iii) The Agency's determination of whether reconsideration is warranted is final.</p>

<p align="left">(6) <i>Revisions to vetting information.</i> (i) Before the order is awarded, any awardee who changes key individuals, whether it has previously passed vetting or not, must submit a revised USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official. This includes changes to key personnel resulting from revisions to the technical proposal.</p>

<p align="left">(ii) The order vetting official will follow the vetting process in paragraph (e) of this clause for any revision of the awardee's Form.</p>

<p align="left">(7) <i>Award of order.</i> The contracting officer may award an order subject to vetting only to an apparently successful awardee that has passed vetting for that order.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Standards for Accessibility for the Disabled in USAID Construction Contracts (July 2007)</b></p>

<p align="left">(a) One of the objectives of the USAID Disability Policy is to engage other U.S. Government agencies, host country counterparts, governments, implementing organizations and other donors in fostering a climate of nondiscrimination against people with disabilities. As part of this policy USAID has established standards for any new or renovation construction project funded by USAID to allow access by people with disabilities (PWDs). The full text of the policy paper can be found at the following Web site: <i>http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/disability/.</i></p>

<p align="left">(b) USAID requires the contractor to comply with standards of accessibility for people with disabilities in all structures, buildings or facilities resulting from new or renovation construction or alterations of an existing structure.</p>

<p align="left">(c) The contractor must comply with the host country or regional standards for accessibility in construction when such standards result in at least substantially equivalent accessibility and usability as the standard provided in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Guidelines of July 2004. Where there are no host country or regional standards for universal access or where the host country or regional standards fail to meet the ADA/ABA threshold, the standard prescribed in the ADA and the ABA must be used.</p>

<p align="left">(d) <i>New Construction.</i> All new construction must comply with the above standards for accessibility.</p>

<p align="left">(e) <i>Alterations.</i> Changes to an existing structure that affect, or could affect, the usability of the structure must comply with the above standards for accessibility unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer's advance approval that compliance is technically infeasible or constitutes an undue burden or both. Compliance is technically infeasible where structural conditions would require removing or altering a load-bearing member that is an essential part of the structural frame or because other existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or features that are in full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements of the standard. Compliance is an undue burden where it entails either a significant difficulty or expense or both.</p>

<p align="left">(f) <i>Exceptions.</i> The following construction related activities are excepted from the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section:</p>

<p align="left">(1) Normal maintenance, re-roofing, painting or wallpapering, or changes to mechanical or electrical systems are not alterations and the above standards do not apply unless they affect the accessibility of the building or facility; and</p>

<p align="left">(2) emergency construction (which may entail the provision of plastic sheeting or tents, minor repair and upgrading of existing structures, rebuilding of part of existing structures, or provision of temporary structures) intended to be temporary in nature. A portion of emergency construction assistance may be provided to people with disabilities as part of the process of identifying disaster- and crisis-affected people as “most vulnerable.”</p>

<p align="left">For use in cost reimbursement contracts performed in whole or in part overseas.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Travel and Transportation (JAN 1990)</b></p>

<p align="left">(a) <i>General.</i> The Contractor will be reimbursed for reasonable, allocable and allowable travel and transportation expenses incurred under and for the performance of this contract. Determination of reasonableness, allocability and allowability will be made by the contracting officer based on the applicable cost principles, the Contractor's established policies and procedures, USAID's established policies and procedures for USAID direct-hire employees, and the particular needs of the project being implemented by this contract. The following paragraphs provide specific guidance and limitations on particular items of cost.</p>

<p align="left">(b) <i>International travel.</i> For travel to and from post of assignment the Contractor shall be reimbursed for travel costs and travel allowances of travelers from place of residence in the United States (or other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost of the travel from the employee's residence in the United States) to the post of duty in the Cooperating Country and return to place of residence in the United States (or other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost of travel from the post of duty in the Cooperating Country to the employee's residence) upon completion of services by the individual. Reimbursement for travel will be in accordance with the applicable cost principles and the provisions of this contract, and will be limited to the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious route. If a regular employee does not complete one full year at post of duty (except for reasons beyond his/her control), the costs of going to and from the post of duty for that employee and his/her dependents are not reimbursable hereunder. If the employee serves more than one year but less than the required service in the Cooperating Country (except for reasons beyond his/her control) the costs of going to the post of duty are reimbursable hereunder but the costs of going from post of duty to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract or other location as approved by the contracting officer are not reimbursable under this contract for the employee and his/her dependents. When travel is by economy class accommodations, the Contractor will be reimbursed for the cost of transporting up to 10 kilograms/22 pounds of accompanied personal baggage per traveler in addition to that regularly allowed with the economy ticket provided that the total number of kilograms/pounds of baggage does not exceed that regularly allowed for first class travelers. Travel allowances for travelers must not be in excess of the rates authorized in the Department of State Standardized Regulations—hereinafter referred to as the Standardized Regulations—as from time to time amended, for not more than the travel time required by scheduled commercial air carrier using the most expeditious route. One stopover en route for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable when the traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be authorized when travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the traveler. Per diem during such stopover shall be paid in accordance with the established practice of the Contractor but not to exceed the amounts stated in the Standardized Regulations.</p>

<p align="left">(c) <i>Local travel.</i> Reimbursement for local travel in connection with duties directly referable to the contract shall not be in excess of the rates established by the Mission Director for the travel costs of travelers in the Cooperating Country. In the absence of such established rates the Contractor shall be reimbursed for actual travel costs of travelers in the Cooperating Country, if not provided by the Cooperating Government or the Mission, including travel allowances at rates not in excess of those prescribed by the Standardized Regulations.</p>

<p align="left">(d) <i>Travel for consultation.</i> The Contractor shall be reimbursed for the round trip of the Contractor's Chief of Party in the Cooperating Country or other designated Contractor employee or consultant in the Cooperating Country performing services required under this Contract, for travel from the Cooperating Country to the Contractor's office in the United States or to USAID/Washington for consultation and return on occasions deemed necessary by the Contractor and approved in advance, in writing, by the contracting officer or the Mission Director.</p>

<p align="left">(e) <i>Special international travel and third country travel.</i> For special travel which advances the purpose of the contract, which is not otherwise provided by the Cooperating Government, and with the prior written approval of the contracting officer or the Mission Director, the Contractor shall be reimbursed for—</p>

<p align="left">(i) The travel cost of travelers other than between the United States and the Cooperating Country and for local travel within other countries and </p>

<p align="left">(ii) Travel allowance for travelers while in travel status and while performing services hereunder in such other countries at rates not in excess of those prescribed by the Standardized Regulations.</p>

<p align="left">(f) <i>Indirect travel for personal convenience.</i> When travel is performed by an indirect route for the personal convenience of the traveler, the allowable costs of such travel will be computed on the basis of the cost of allowable air fare via the direct usually traveled route. If such costs include fares for air or ocean travel by foreign flag carriers, approval for indirect travel by such foreign flag carriers must be obtained from the contracting officer or the Mission Director before such travel is undertaken, otherwise only that portion of travel accomplished by United States-flag carriers will be reimbursable within the above limitation of allowable costs.</p>

<p align="left">(g) <i>Limitation on travel by dependents.</i> Travel costs and allowances will be allowed only for dependents of regular employees and such costs shall be reimbursed for travel from place of abode to assigned station in the Cooperating Country and return, only if dependent remains in the country for at least 9 months or one-half of the required tour of duty of the regular employee responsible for such dependent, whichever is greater. If the dependent is eligible for educational travel pursuant to the “Differential and Allowances” clause of this contract, time spent away from post resulting from educational travel will be counted as time at post.</p>

<p align="left">(h) <i>Delays en route.</i> The Contractor may grant to travelers under this contract reasonable delays en route while in travel status when such delays are caused by events beyond the control of such traveler or Contractor. It is understood that if delay is caused by physical incapacitation, personnel shall be eligible for such sick leave as provided under the “Leave and Holidays” clause of this contract.</p>

<p align="left">(i) <i>Travel by privately owned automobile.</i> The Contractor shall be reimbursed for the cost of travel performed by a regular employee in his/her privately owned automobile at a rate not to exceed that authorized in the Federal Travel Regulations plus authorized per diem for the employee and for each of the authorized dependents traveling in the automobile, if the automobile is being driven to or from the Cooperating Country as authorized under the contract, provided that the total cost of the mileage and the per diem paid to all authorized travelers shall not exceed the total constructive cost of fare and normal per diem by all authorized travelers by surface common carrier or authorized air fare, whichever is less.</p>

<p align="left">(j) <i>Emergency and irregular travel and transportation.</i> Emergency transportation costs and travel allowances while en route, as provided in this section will also be reimbursed not to exceed amounts authorized by the Foreign Service Travel Regulations for USAID-direct hire employees in like circumstances under the following conditions:</p>

<p align="left">(1) The costs of going from post of duty in the Cooperating Country to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract or other location for Contractor employees and dependents and returning to the post of duty, when the Contractor's Chief of Party, with the concurrence of the Contracting Officer or Mission Director makes a written determination that such travel is necessary for one of the reasons specified in subparagraphs (j)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. A copy of the written determination shall be furnished to the contracting officer.</p>

<p align="left">(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned, or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty, subject in either case, to the limitations stated in the clause of this contract entitled “Personnel—Physical Fitness of Employee and Dependents.” The Mission Director may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contract expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.</p>

<p align="left">(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.</p>

<p align="left">(2) When, for any reason, the Mission Director determines it is necessary to evacuate the Contractor's entire team (employees and dependents) or Contractor dependents only, the Contractor will be reimbursed for travel and transportation expenses and travel allowance while en route, for the cost of the individuals going from post of duty in the Cooperating Country to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract or other approved location. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the Mission Director when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so.</p>

<p align="left">(3) The Mission Director may also authorize emergency or irregular travel and transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. The authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and/or household effects, etc. Requests for such emergency travel shall be submitted through the Contractor's Chief of Party.</p>

<p align="left">(k) <i>Home leave travel.</i> To the extent that home leave has been authorized as provided in the “Leave and Holidays” clause of this contract, the cost of travel for home leave is reimbursable for travel costs and travel allowances of travelers from the post of duty in the Cooperating Country to place of residence in the United States (or other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost of travel to the employee's residence in the United States) and return to the post of duty in the Cooperating Country. Reimbursement for travel will be in accordance with the applicable cost principles and the provisions of this contract, and will be limited to the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious route. When travel is by economy class accommodations, the Contractor will be reimbursed for the cost of transporting up to 10 kilograms/22 pounds of accompanied personal baggage per traveler in addition to that regularly allowed with the economy ticket provided that the total number of kilograms/pounds of baggage does not exceed that regularly allowed for first class travelers. Travel allowances for travelers shall not be in excess of the rates authorized in the Standardized Regulations as from time to time amended, for not more than the travel time required by scheduled commercial air carrier using the most expeditious route. One stopover en route for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable when the traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be authorized when travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the traveler. Per diem during such stopover shall be paid in accordance with the established practice of the Contractor but not to exceed the amounts stated in the Standardized Regulations.</p>

<p align="left">(l) <i>Rest and recuperation travel.</i> The Contractor shall be reimbursed for the cost of travel performed by regular employees and dependents for purposes of rest and recuperation provided that such reimbursement does not exceed that authorized for USAID direct hire employees, and provided further that no reimbursement will be made unless approval is given by the Contractor's Chief of party.</p>

<p align="left">(m) <i>Transportation of motor vehicles, personal effects and household goods.</i> (1) Transportation, including packing and crating costs, will be paid for shipping from the point of origin in the United States (or other location as approved by the contracting officer) to post of duty in the Cooperating Country and return to point of origin in the United States (or other location as approved by the contracting officer) of one privately-owned vehicle for each regular employee, personal effects of travelers and household goods of each regular employee not to exceed the limitations in effect for such shipments for USAID direct hire employees in accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations as in effect when shipment is made.</p>

<p align="left">(2) If a regular employee does not complete one full year at post of duty (except for reasons beyond his/her control), the costs for transportation of vehicles, effects and goods to and from the post of duty are not reimbursable hereunder. If the employee serves more than one year but less than the required service in the Cooperating Country (except for reasons beyond his/her control) the costs for transportation of vehicles, effects and goods to the post of duty are reimbursable hereunder but the costs for transportation of vehicles, effects and goods from post of duty to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract or other location as approved by the contracting officer are not reimbursable under this contract.</p>

<p align="left">(3) The cost of transporting motor vehicles and household goods shall not exceed the cost of packing, crating and transportation by surface. In the event that the carrier does not require boxing or crating of motor vehicles for shipment to the Cooperating Country, the cost of boxing or crating is not reimbursable. The transportation of a privately-owned motor vehicle for a regular employee may be authorized by the Contractor as replacement of the last such motor vehicle shipped under this contract for the employee when the Mission Director or his/her designee determines in advance and so notifies the Contractor in writing that the replacement is necessary for reasons not due to the negligence or malfeasance of the regular employee. The determination shall be made under the same rules and regulations that apply to Mission employees.</p>

<p align="left">(n) <i>Unaccompanied baggage.</i> Unaccompanied baggage is considered to be those personal belongings needed by the traveler immediately upon arrival at destination. To permit the arrival of effects to coincide with the arrival of regular employees and dependents, consideration should be given to advance shipments of unaccompanied baggage. The Contractor will be reimbursed for costs of shipment of unaccompanied baggage (in addition to the weight allowance for household effects) not to exceed the limitations in effect for USAID direct hire employees in accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations as in effect when shipment is made.</p>

<p align="left">This unaccompanied baggage may be shipped as air freight by the most direct route between authorized points of origin and destination regardless of the modes of travel used. This provision is applicable to home leave travel and to short-term employees when these are authorized by the terms of this contract.</p>

<p align="left">(o) <i>Storage of household effects.</i> The cost of storage charges (including packing, crating, and drayage costs) in the U.S. of household goods of regular employees will be permitted in lieu of transportation of all or any part of such goods to the Cooperating Country under paragraph (m) above provided that the total amount of effects shipped to the Cooperating Country or stored in the U.S. shall not exceed the amount authorized for USAID direct hire employees under the Uniform Foreign Service Travel Regulations.</p>

<p align="left">(p) <i>International ocean transportation.</i> (1) Flag eligibility requirements for ocean carriage are covered by the “Source and Nationality Requirements” clause of this contract.</p>

<p align="left">(i) Transportation of goods. Where U.S. flag vessels are not available, or their use would result in a significant delay, the Contractor must contact the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Transportation Division (M/OAA/T) for required guidance and may obtain a release from this requirement from M/OAA/T. The contact email address for these matters is <i>Oceantransportation@USAID.gov.</i></p>

<p align="left">(ii) <i>Transportation of persons.</i> Where U.S. flag vessels are not available, or their use would result in a significant delay, the Contractor may obtain a release from this requirement from the contracting officer or the Mission Director, as appropriate.</p>

<p align="left">(2) <i>Transportation of foreign-made vehicles.</i> Reimbursement of the costs of transporting a foreign-made motor vehicle will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Service Travel Regulations.</p>

<p align="left">(3) <i>Reduced rates on U.S. flag carriers.</i> Reduced rates on United States flag carriers are in effect for shipments of household goods and personal effects of USAID contract personnel.

<p align="left">This clause is for use in any USAID contract which involves research using human subjects.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Protection of the Individual as a Research Subject (AUG 1995)</b></p>

<p align="left">(a) Safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects in research conducted under a USAID contract is the responsibility of the contractor. USAID has adopted the Common Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. USAID's Policy is found in Part 225 of Title 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the “Policy”). Additional interpretation, procedures, and implementation guidance of the Policy are found in USAID General Notice entitled “Procedures for the Protection of Human Subjects in Research Supported by USAID”, issued April 19, 1995, as from time to time amended (a copy of which is attached to this contract). USAID's Cognizant Human Subjects Officer (CHSO) and USAID/W has oversight, guidance, and interpretation responsibility for the Policy.</p>

<p align="left">(b) Contractors must comply with the Policy when humans are the subject of research, as defined in 22 CFR 225.102(d), performed as part of the contract, and contractors must provide “assurance”, as required by 22 CFR 225.103, that they follow and abide by the procedures in the Policy. See also Section 5 of the April 19, 1995, USAID General Notice which sets forth activities to which the Policy is applicable. The existence of a bona fide, applicable assurance approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) such as the “multiple project assurance” (MPA) will satisfy this requirement. Alternatively, contractors can provide an acceptable written assurance to USAID as described in 22 CFR 225.103. Such assurances must be determined by the CHSO to be acceptable prior to any applicable research being initiated or conducted under the contract. In some limited instances outside the U.S., alternative systems for the protection of human subjects may be used provided they are deemed “at least equivalent” to those outlined in part 225 (see 22 CFR 225.101(h)). Criteria and procedures for making this determination are described in the General Notice cited in the preceding paragraph.</p>

<p align="left">(c) Since the welfare of the research subject is a matter of concern to USAID as well as to the contractor, USAID staff, consultants and advisory groups may independently review and inspect research, and research processes and procedures involving human subjects, and based on such findings, the CHSO may prohibit research which presents unacceptable hazards or otherwise fails to comply with USAID procedures. Informed consent documents must include the stipulation that the subject's records may be subject to such review.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Use of Pouch Facilities (JUL 1997)</b></p>

<p align="left">(a) Use of diplomatic pouch is controlled by the Department of State. The Department of State has authorized the use of pouch facilities for USAID contractors and their employees as a general policy, as detailed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this clause; however, the final decision regarding use of pouch facilities rests with the Embassy or USAID Mission. In consideration of the use of pouch facilities as hereinafter stated, the Contractor and its employees agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Department of State and USAID against loss or damage occurring in pouch transmission.</p>

<p align="left">(1) Contractors and their employees are authorized use of the pouch for transmission and receipt of up to a maximum of 0.9 kilogram/2 pounds per shipment of correspondence and documents needed in the administration of foreign assistance programs.</p>

<p align="left">(2) U.S. citizen employees of U.S. contractors are authorized use of the pouch for personal mail up to a maximum of 0.5 kilogram/one pound per shipment (but see paragraph (a)(3) of this section).</p>

<p align="left">(3) Merchandise, parcels, magazines, or newspapers are not considered to be personal mail for purposes of this clause, and are not authorized to be sent or received by pouch.</p>

<p align="left">(4) Official mail as authorized by paragraph (a)(1) of this clause should be addressed as follows: Individual or Organization name, followed by the symbol “C”, city Name of Post, U.S. Agency for International Development, Washington, DC 20523-0001.</p>

<p align="left">(5) Personal mail pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this clause should be sent to the address specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this clause, but without the name of the organization.</p>

<p align="left">(6) Mail sent via the diplomatic pouch may not be in violation of U.S. Postal laws and may not contain material ineligible for pouch transmission.</p>

<p align="left">(7) USAID contractor personnel are not authorized use of military postal facilities (APO/FPO). This is an Adjutant General's decision based on existing laws and regulations governing military postal facilities and is being enforced worldwide. Posts having access to APO/FPO facilities and using such for diplomatic pouch dispatch, may, however, accept official mail from Contractors and letter mail from their employees for the pouch, provided of course, adequate postage is affixed.</p>

<p align="left">For use in any USAID contract under which USAID participants are trained.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Health and Accident Coverage for USAID Participant Trainees (JAN 1999)</b></p>

<p align="left">(a) In accordance with the requirements of USAID Automated Directive System (ADS) 253, the Contractor shall enroll all non-U.S. trainees (hereinafter referred to as “participants”), whose training in the U.S. is financed by USAID under this contract, in USAID's Health and Accident Coverage (HAC) program. Sponsored trainees enrolled in third-country or in-country training events are not eligible for USAID's HAC program, but the Contractor may obtain alternative local medical and accident insurance at contract expense, provided the cost is consistent with the cost principles in (48 CFR) <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR31.doc#s312. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/31.htm#P175_33848">FAR 31.2</a></u></font>.</p>

<p align="left">(b) When enrollment in the HAC program is required per paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor must enroll each participant in the HAC program through one of two designated contractors prior to the initiation of travel by the participant. USAID has developed an Agency-wide database training management system, the Training Results and Information Network (“TraiNet”), which is the preferred system for managing USAID's participant training program, including enrollment in the HAC program. However, until such time as the USAID sponsoring unit (as defined in ADS 253) has given the Contractor access to USAID's “TraiNet” software for trainee tracking and HAC enrollment, the Contractor must fill out and mail the Participant Data Form (PDF) (Form USAID 1381-4) to USAID. The Contractor can obtain information regarding each HAC program contractor, including contact information, and a supply of the PDF forms and instructions for completing and submitting them, by contacting the data base contractor serving the Director, Bureau for Economic Growth, Education and Environment, Office of Education (E3/ED).</p>

<p align="left">(c) The Contractor must ensure that HAC enrollment begins immediately upon the participant's departure for the United States for the purpose of participating in a training program financed by USAID, and that enrollment continues in full force and effect until the participant returns to his/her country of origin, or is released from USAID's responsibility, whichever is the sooner.</p>

<p align="left">(1) The HAC insurance provider, not the Contractor, shall be responsible for paying all reasonable and necessary medical reimbursement charges not otherwise covered by student health service or other insurance programs, subject to the availability of funds for such purposes, in accordance with the standards of coverage established by USAID under its HAC program and by the HAC providers' contracts.</p>

<p align="left">(2) After HAC enrollment, upon receipt of HAC services invoice from the selected HAC provider, the Contractor shall submit payment directly to the HAC provider.</p>

<p align="left">(3) The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that participants and any stakeholders (as defined in ADS 253) are advised that USAID is not responsible for any medical claims in excess of the coverages provided by the HAC program, or for medical claims not eligible for coverage under the HAC program, or not otherwise covered in this section.</p>

<p align="left">(d) The Contractor, to the extent that it is an educational institution with a mandatory student health service program, shall also enroll participants in that institution's student health service program. Medical costs which are covered under the institution's student health service shall not be eligible for payment under USAID's HAC program.</p>

<p align="left">(e) If the Contractor has a mandatory, non-waivable health and accident insurance program for students, the costs of such insurance will be allowable under this contract. Any claims eligible under such insurance will not be payable under USAID's HAC plan or under this contract. Even though the participant is covered by the Contractor's mandatory, non-waivable health and accident insurance program, the participant MUST be enrolled in USAID's more comprehensive HAC program.</p>

<p align="left">(f) Medical conditions pre-existing to the participant's sponsorship for training by USAID, discovered during the required pre-departure medical examination, are grounds for ineligibility for sponsorship unless specifically waived by the sponsoring unit, and covered through a separate insurance policy maintained by the participant or his employer, or a letter of guarantee from the participant or the employer (which thereby assumes liability for any related charges that might materialize. See ADS 253).</p>

<p><a name="P787_131232"></a><b>752.7028   Differential and allowances.</b></p>

<p align="left">The following clause is for use in all USAID cost reimbursement contracts performed in whole or in part overseas.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Differentials and Allowances (JUL 1996)</b></p>

<p align="left">(This clause does not apply to TCN or CCN employees. TCN and CCN employees are not eligible for differentials and allowances, unless specifically authorized by the cognizant Assistant Administrator or Mission Director. A copy of such authorization shall be retained and made available as part of the contractor's records which are required to be preserved and made available by the “Examination of Records by the Comptroller General” and “Audit” clauses of this contract).</p>

<p align="left">(a) <i>Post differential.</i> Post differential is an additional compensation for service at places in foreign areas where conditions of environment differ substantially from conditions of environment in the continental United States and warrant additional compensation as a recruitment and retention incentive. In areas where post differential is paid to USAID direct-hire employees, post differential not to exceed the percentage of salary as is provided such USAID employees in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 500 (except the limitation contained in Section 552, “Ceiling on Payment”) Tables-Chapter 900, as from time to time amended, will be reimbursable hereunder for employees in respect to amounts earned during the time such employees actually spend overseas on work under this contract. When such post differential is provided to regular employees of the Contractor, it shall be payable beginning on the date of arrival at the post of assignment and continue, including periods away from post on official business, until the close of business on the day of departure from post of assignment en route to the United States. Sick or vacation leave taken at or away from the post of assignment will not interrupt the continuity of the assignment or require a discontinuance of such post differential payments, provided such leave is not taken within the United States or the territories of the United States. Post differential will not be payable while the employee is away from his/her post of assignment for purposes of home leave. Short-term employees shall be entitled to post differential beginning with the forty-third (43rd) day at post.</p>

<p align="left">(b) <i>Living quarters allowance.</i> Living quarters allowance is an allowance granted to reimburse an employee for substantially all of his/her cost for either temporary or residence quarters whenever Government-owned or Government-rented quarters are not provided to him/her at his/her post without charge. Such costs are those incurred for temporary lodging (temporary lodging allowance) or one unit of residence quarters (living quarters allowance) and include rent, plus any costs not included therein for heat, light, fuel, gas, electricity and water. The temporary lodging allowance and the living quarters allowance are never both payable to an employee for the same period of time. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees for a living quarters allowance for rent and utilities if such facilities are not supplied. Such allowance shall not exceed the amount paid USAID employees of equivalent rank in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with either the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 130, as from time to time amended, or other rates approved by the Mission Director. Subject to the written approval of the Mission Director, short-term employees may be paid per diem (in lieu of living quarters allowance) at rates prescribed by the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended, during the time such short-term employees spend at posts of duty in the Cooperating Country under this contract. In authorizing such per diem rates, the Mission Director shall consider the particular circumstances involved with respect to each such short-term employee including the extent to which meals and/or lodging may be made available without charge or at nominal cost by an agency of the United States Government or of the Cooperating Government, and similar factors.</p>

<p align="left">(c) <i>Temporary quarters subsistence allowance.</i> Temporary quarters subsistence allowance is a quarters allowance granted to an employee for the reasonable cost of temporary quarters incurred by the employee and his family for a period not in excess of (i) 90 days after first arrival at a new post in a foreign area or a period ending with the occupation of residence (permanent) quarters, if earlier, and (ii) 30 days immediately preceding final departure from the post subsequent to the necessary vacating of residence quarters, unless an extension is authorized in writing by the Mission Director. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees and authorized dependents for temporary quarters subsistence allowance, in lieu of living quarters allowance, not to exceed the amount set forth in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 120, as from time to time amended.</p>

<p align="left">(d) <i>Post allowance.</i> Post allowance is a cost-of-living allowance granted to an employee officially stationed at a post where the cost of living, exclusive of quarters cost, is substantially higher than in Washington, DC. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees for post allowance not to exceed those paid USAID employees in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 220, as from time to time amended.</p>

<p align="left">(e) <i>Supplemental post allowance.</i> Supplemental post allowance is a form of post allowance granted to an employee at his/her post when it is determined that assistance is necessary to defray extraordinary subsistence costs. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees for supplemental post allowance not to exceed the amount set forth in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 230, as from time to time amended.</p>

<p align="left">(f) <i>Educational allowance.</i> Educational allowance is an allowance to assist an employee in meeting the extraordinary and necessary expenses, not otherwise compensated for, incurred by reason of his/her service in a foreign area in providing adequate elementary and secondary education for his/her children. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to regular employees for educational allowances for their dependent children in amounts not to exceed those set forth in the Standardized (Regulations Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 270, as from time to time amended.</p>

<p align="left">(g) <i>Educational travel.</i> Educational travel is travel to and from a school in the United States for secondary education (in lieu of an educational allowance) and for college education. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to regular employees for educational travel for their dependent children provided such payment does not exceed that which would be payable in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 280, as from time to time amended. Educational travel shall not be authorized for regular employees whose assignment is less than two years.</p>

<p align="left">(h) <i>Separate maintenance allowance.</i> Separate maintenance allowance is an allowance to assist an employee who is compelled, by reason of dangerous, notably unhealthful, or excessively adverse living conditions at his/her post of assignment in a foreign area, or for the convenience of the Government, to meet the additional expense of maintaining his/her dependents elsewhere than at such post. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to regular employees for a separate maintenance allowance not to exceed that made to Aid employees in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 260, as from time to time amended.</p>

<p align="left">(i) <i>Payments during evacuation.</i> The Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) provide the authority for efficient, orderly, and equitable procedure for the payment of compensation, post differential and allowances in the event of an emergency evacuation of employees or their dependents, or both, from duty stations for military or other reasons or because of imminent danger to their lives. If evacuation has been authorized by the Mission Director the Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees and authorized dependents evacuated from their post of assignment in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 600, and the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended.</p>

<p align="left">(j) <i>Danger pay allowance.</i> (1) The contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to its employees for danger pay not to exceed that paid USAID employees in the cooperating country, in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 650, as from time to time amended.</p>

<p align="left">(2) Danger pay is an allowance that provides additional compensation above basic compensation to an employee in a foreign area where civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism or wartime conditions threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the health or well-being of the employee. The danger pay allowance is in lieu of that part of the post differential which is attributable to political violence. Consequently, the post differential may be reduced while danger pay is in effect to avoid dual crediting for political violence.</p>

<p align="left">(3) Vacation leave earned but not taken by the end of the employee's tour pursuant to paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this clause will be forfeited unless the requirements of the project precluded the employee from taking such leave, and the contracting officer (with the endorsement of the Mission) approves one of the following as an alternative:</p>

<p align="left">(ii) Lump-sum payment for leave not taken provided such leave does not exceed the number of days which can be earned by the employee during a twelve-month period.</p>

<p align="left">(b) <i>Sick Leave.</i> Sick leave is earned by employees in accordance with the Contractor's usual practice but not to exceed 13 work days per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Additional sick leave after use of accrued vacation leave may be advanced in accordance with Contractor's usual practice, if in the judgment of the Contractor's Chief of Party it is determined that such additional leave is in the best interest of the project. In no event shall such additional leave exceed 30 days. The Contractor agrees to reimburse USAID for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the employee's assignment under this contract. Sick leave earned and unused at the end of a regular tour of duty may be carried over to an immediately-succeeding tour of duty under this contract. The use of home leave authorized under this clause shall not constitute a break in service for the purpose of sick leave carry-over. Contractor employees will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of their duties under this contract.</p>

<p align="left">(c) <i>Home leave.</i> (1) Home leave is leave earned for service abroad for use only in the United States, in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or in the possessions of the United States.</p>

<p align="left">(i) Granting of advance home leave would in each case serve to advance the attainment of the objectives of this contract;</p>

<p align="left">(ii) The regular employee shall have served a minimum of 18 months in the Cooperating Country on his/her current tour of duty under this contract; and</p>

<p align="left">(iii) The regular employee shall have agreed to return to the Cooperating Country to serve out the remainder of his/her current tour of duty and an additional 2 year appointment under this contract, or such other additional appointment of not less than 1 year of overseas service as the Mission Director may approve.</p>

<p align="left">(4) The period of service overseas required under paragraph (c)(2) or paragraph (c)(3) of this clause shall include the actual days spent in orientation in the United States (less language training) and the actual days overseas beginning on the date of departure from the United States port of embarkation on international travel and continuing, inclusive of authorized delays en route, to the date of arrival at the United States port of debarkation from international travel.

A copy of any such approval shall be provided to the contracting officer.</p>

<p align="left">(f) <i>Leave Records.</i> The Contractor's leave records shall be preserved and made available as part of the contractor's records which are required to be preserved and made available by the Examination of Records by the Comptroller General and Audit clauses of this contract.</p>
