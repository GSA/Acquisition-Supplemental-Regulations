                                    <p class="p List1">(c) Source selection proceeds separately from vetting. Vetting is conducted independently from any discussions the contracting officer may have with an offeror. The offeror and any subcontractor subject to vetting must not provide vetting information to other than the vetting official. The offeror and any subcontractor subject to vetting will communicate only with the vetting official regarding their vetting submission(s) and not with any other USAID or USG personnel, including the contracting officer or his/her representatives. Exchanges between the Government and an offeror about vetting information submitted by the offeror or any proposed subcontractor are clarifications in accordance with (48 CFR) FAR 15.306(a) (48 CFR 15.306(a)). The contracting officer designates the vetting official as the only individual authorized to clarify the offeror's and proposed subcontractor's vetting information.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) The fair opportunity process proceeds separately from vetting. Vetting is conducted independently from any discussions the contracting officer may have with an awardee. The awardee and any subcontractor subject to vetting must not provide vetting information to other than the vetting official identified in the request for order proposal. The awardee and any subcontractor subject to vetting will communicate only with the vetting official regarding their vetting submission(s) and not with any other USAID or USG personnel, including the contracting officer or his/her representatives.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) One of the objectives of the USAID Disability Policy is to engage other U.S. Government agencies, host country counterparts, governments, implementing organizations and other donors in fostering a climate of nondiscrimination against people with disabilities. As part of this policy USAID has established standards for any new or renovation construction project funded by USAID to allow access by people with disabilities (PWDs). The full text of the policy paper can be found at the following Web site: <em class="ph i">http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/disability/.</em>

</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(c) The contractor must comply with the host country or regional standards for accessibility in construction when such standards result in at least substantially equivalent accessibility and usability as the standard provided in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Guidelines of July 2004. Where there are no host country or regional standards for universal access or where the host country or regional standards fail to meet the ADA/ABA threshold, the standard prescribed in the ADA and the ABA must be used.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">New Construction.</em> All new construction must comply with the above standards for accessibility.

Compliance is technically infeasible where structural conditions would require removing or altering a load-bearing member that is an essential part of the structural frame or because other existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or features that are in full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements of the standard. Compliance is an undue burden where it entails either a significant difficulty or expense or both.

Reimbursement for travel will be in accordance with the applicable cost principles and the provisions of this contract, and will be limited to the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious route. If a regular employee does not complete one full year at post of duty (except for reasons beyond his/her control), the costs of going to and from the post of duty for that employee and his/her dependents are not reimbursable hereunder. If the employee serves more than one year but less than the required service in the Cooperating Country (except for reasons beyond his/her control) the costs of going to the post of duty are reimbursable hereunder but the costs of going from post of duty to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract or other location as approved by the contracting officer are not reimbursable under this contract for the employee and his/her dependents. When travel is by economy class accommodations, the Contractor will be reimbursed for the cost of transporting up to 10 kilograms/22 pounds of accompanied personal baggage per traveler in addition to that regularly allowed with the economy ticket provided that the total number of kilograms/pounds of baggage does not exceed that regularly allowed for first class travelers. Travel allowances for travelers must not be in excess of the rates authorized in the Department of State Standardized Regulations - hereinafter referred to as the Standardized Regulations - as from time to time amended, for not more than the travel time required by scheduled commercial air carrier using the most expeditious route. One stopover en route for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable when the traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be authorized when travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the traveler.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) Safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects in research conducted under a USAID contract is the responsibility of the contractor. USAID has adopted the Common Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. USAID's Policy is found in Part 225 of Title 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the “Policy”). Additional interpretation, procedures, and implementation guidance of the Policy are found in USAID General Notice entitled “Procedures for the Protection of Human Subjects in Research Supported by USAID”, issued April 19, 1995, as from time to time amended (a copy of which is attached to this contract). USAID's Cognizant Human Subjects Officer (CHSO) and USAID/W has oversight, guidance, and interpretation responsibility for the Policy.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(b) Contractors must comply with the Policy when humans are the subject of research, as defined in 22 CFR 225.102(d), performed as part of the contract, and contractors must provide “assurance”, as required by 22 CFR 225.103, that they follow and abide by the procedures in the Policy. See also Section 5 of the April 19, 1995, USAID General Notice which sets forth activities to which the Policy is applicable. The existence of a bona fide, applicable assurance approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) such as the “multiple project assurance” (MPA) will satisfy this requirement. Alternatively, contractors can provide an acceptable written assurance to USAID as described in 22 CFR 225.103. Such assurances must be determined by the CHSO to be acceptable prior to any applicable research being initiated or conducted under the contract. In some limited instances outside the U.S., alternative systems for the protection of human subjects may be used provided they are deemed “at least equivalent” to those outlined in part 225 (see 22 CFR 225.101(h)). Criteria and procedures for making this determination are described in the General Notice cited in the preceding paragraph.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(c) Since the welfare of the research subject is a matter of concern to USAID as well as to the contractor, USAID staff, consultants and advisory groups may independently review and inspect research, and research processes and procedures involving human subjects, and based on such findings, the CHSO may prohibit research which presents unacceptable hazards or otherwise fails to comply with USAID procedures. Informed consent documents must include the stipulation that the subject's records may be subject to such review.</p>

</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) Use of diplomatic pouch is controlled by the Department of State. The Department of State has authorized the use of pouch facilities for USAID contractors and their employees as a general policy, as detailed in paragraphs (a)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			through (a)(7) of this clause; however, the final decision regarding use of pouch facilities rests with the Embassy or USAID Mission. In consideration of the use of pouch facilities as hereinafter stated, the Contractor and its employees agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Department of State and USAID against loss or damage occurring in pouch transmission.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) Contractors and their employees are authorized use of the pouch for transmission and receipt of up to a maximum of 0.9 kilogram/2 pounds per shipment of correspondence and documents needed in the administration of foreign assistance programs.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Merchandise, parcels, magazines, or newspapers are not considered to be personal mail for purposes of this clause, and are not authorized to be sent or received by pouch.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) Official mail as authorized by paragraph (a)(1) of this clause should be addressed as follows: Individual or Organization name, followed by the symbol “C”, city Name of Post, U.S. Agency for International Development, Washington, DC 20523-0001.

                                    <p class="p List2">(7) USAID contractor personnel are not authorized use of military postal facilities (APO/FPO).

                                    <p class="p HD1">Health and Accident Coverage for USAID Participant Trainees (JAN 1999)
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) In accordance with the requirements of USAID Automated Directive System (ADS) 253, the Contractor shall enroll all non-U.S. trainees (hereinafter referred to as “participants”), whose training in the U.S. is financed by USAID under this contract, in USAID's Health and Accident Coverage (HAC) program. Sponsored trainees enrolled in third-country or in-country training events are not eligible for USAID's HAC program, but the Contractor may obtain alternative local medical and accident insurance at contract expense, provided the cost is consistent with the cost principles in (48 CFR) FAR 31.2.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(b) When enrollment in the HAC program is required per paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor must enroll each participant in the HAC program through one of two designated contractors prior to the initiation of travel by the participant. USAID has developed an Agency-wide database training management system, the Training Results and Information Network (“TraiNet”), which is the preferred system for managing USAID's participant training program, including enrollment in the HAC program. However, until such time as the USAID sponsoring unit (as defined in ADS 253) has given the Contractor access to USAID's “TraiNet” software for trainee tracking and HAC enrollment, the Contractor must fill out and mail the Participant Data Form (PDF) (Form USAID 1381-4) to USAID. The Contractor can obtain information regarding each HAC program contractor, including contact information, and a supply of the PDF forms and instructions for completing and submitting them, by contacting the data base contractor serving the Director, Bureau for Economic Growth, Education and Environment, Office of Education (E3/ED).
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(c) The Contractor must ensure that HAC enrollment begins immediately upon the participant's departure for the United States for the purpose of participating in a training program financed by USAID, and that enrollment continues in full force and effect until the participant returns to his/her country of origin, or is released from USAID's responsibility, whichever is the sooner.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) The HAC insurance provider, not the Contractor, shall be responsible for paying all reasonable and necessary medical reimbursement charges not otherwise covered by student health service or other insurance programs, subject to the availability of funds for such purposes, in accordance with the standards of coverage established by USAID under its HAC program and by the HAC providers' contracts.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) After HAC enrollment, upon receipt of HAC services invoice from the selected HAC provider, the Contractor shall submit payment directly to the HAC provider.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that participants and any stakeholders (as defined in ADS 253) are advised that USAID is not responsible for any medical claims in excess of the coverages provided by the HAC program, or for medical claims not eligible for coverage under the HAC program, or not otherwise covered in this section.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(d) The Contractor, to the extent that it is an educational institution with a mandatory student health service program, shall also enroll participants in that institution's student health service program. Medical costs which are covered under the institution's student health service shall not be eligible for payment under USAID's HAC program.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(e) If the Contractor has a mandatory, non-waivable health and accident insurance program for students, the costs of such insurance will be allowable under this contract. Any claims eligible under such insurance will not be payable under USAID's HAC plan or under this contract. Even though the participant is covered by the Contractor's mandatory, non-waivable health and accident insurance program, the participant MUST be enrolled in USAID's more comprehensive HAC program.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(f) Medical conditions pre-existing to the participant's sponsorship for training by USAID, discovered during the required pre-departure medical examination, are grounds for ineligibility for sponsorship unless specifically waived by the sponsoring unit, and covered through a separate insurance policy maintained by the participant or his employer, or a letter of guarantee from the participant or the employer (which thereby assumes liability for any related charges that might materialize. See ADS 253).</p>

</p>
                                    <p class="p P">(This clause does not apply to TCN or CCN employees. TCN and CCN employees are not eligible for differentials and allowances, unless specifically authorized by the cognizant Assistant Administrator or Mission Director. A copy of such authorization shall be retained and made available as part of the contractor's records which are required to be preserved and made available by the “Examination of Records by the Comptroller General” and “Audit” clauses of this contract).
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Post differential.</em> Post differential is an additional compensation for service at places in foreign areas where conditions of environment differ substantially from conditions of environment in the continental United States and warrant additional compensation as a recruitment and retention incentive. In areas where post differential is paid to USAID direct-hire employees, post differential not to exceed the percentage of salary as is provided such USAID employees in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 500 (except the limitation contained in Section 552, “Ceiling on Payment”) Tables-Chapter 900, as from time to time amended, will be reimbursable hereunder for employees in respect to amounts earned during the time such employees actually spend overseas on work under this contract. When such post differential is provided to regular employees of the Contractor, it shall be payable beginning on the date of arrival at the post of assignment and continue, including periods away from post on official business, until the close of business on the day of departure from post of assignment en route to the United States. Sick or vacation leave taken at or away from the post of assignment will not interrupt the continuity of the assignment or require a discontinuance of such post differential payments, provided such leave is not taken within the United States or the territories of the United States. Post differential will not be payable while the employee is away from his/her post of assignment for purposes of home leave. Short-term employees shall be entitled to post differential beginning with the forty-third (43rd) day at post.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Living quarters allowance.</em> Living quarters allowance is an allowance granted to reimburse an employee for substantially all of his/her cost for either temporary or residence quarters whenever Government-owned or Government-rented quarters are not provided to him/her at his/her post without charge. Such costs are those incurred for temporary lodging (temporary lodging allowance) or one unit of residence quarters (living quarters allowance) and include rent, plus any costs not included therein for heat, light, fuel, gas, electricity and water. The temporary lodging allowance and the living quarters allowance are never both payable to an employee for the same period of time. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees for a living quarters allowance for rent and utilities if such facilities are not supplied. Such allowance shall not exceed the amount paid USAID employees of equivalent rank in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with either the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 130, as from time to time amended, or other rates approved by the Mission Director. Subject to the written approval of the Mission Director, short-term employees may be paid per diem (in lieu of living quarters allowance) at rates prescribed by the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended, during the time such short-term employees spend at posts of duty in the Cooperating Country under this contract. In authorizing such per diem rates, the Mission Director shall consider the particular circumstances involved with respect to each such short-term employee including the extent to which meals and/or lodging may be made available without charge or at nominal cost by an agency of the United States Government or of the Cooperating Government, and similar factors.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Temporary quarters subsistence allowance.</em> Temporary quarters subsistence allowance is a quarters allowance granted to an employee for the reasonable cost of temporary quarters incurred by the employee and his family for a period not in excess of (i) 90 days after first arrival at a new post in a foreign area or a period ending with the occupation of residence (permanent) quarters, if earlier, and (ii) 30 days immediately preceding final departure from the post subsequent to the necessary vacating of residence quarters, unless an extension is authorized in writing by the Mission Director. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees and authorized dependents for temporary quarters subsistence allowance, in lieu of living quarters allowance, not to exceed the amount set forth in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 120, as from time to time amended.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Post allowance.</em> Post allowance is a cost-of-living allowance granted to an employee officially stationed at a post where the cost of living, exclusive of quarters cost, is substantially higher than in Washington, DC. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees for post allowance not to exceed those paid USAID employees in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 220, as from time to time amended.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Supplemental post allowance.</em> Supplemental post allowance is a form of post allowance granted to an employee at his/her post when it is determined that assistance is necessary to defray extraordinary subsistence costs. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees for supplemental post allowance not to exceed the amount set forth in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 230, as from time to time amended.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Educational allowance.</em> Educational allowance is an allowance to assist an employee in meeting the extraordinary and necessary expenses, not otherwise compensated for, incurred by reason of his/her service in a foreign area in providing adequate elementary and secondary education for his/her children. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to regular employees for educational allowances for their dependent children in amounts not to exceed those set forth in the Standardized (Regulations Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 270, as from time to time amended.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(g) <em class="ph i">Educational travel.</em> Educational travel is travel to and from a school in the United States for secondary education (in lieu of an educational allowance) and for college education. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to regular employees for educational travel for their dependent children provided such payment does not exceed that which would be payable in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 280, as from time to time amended. Educational travel shall not be authorized for regular employees whose assignment is less than two years.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(h) <em class="ph i">Separate maintenance allowance.</em> Separate maintenance allowance is an allowance to assist an employee who is compelled, by reason of dangerous, notably unhealthful, or excessively adverse living conditions at his/her post of assignment in a foreign area, or for the convenience of the Government, to meet the additional expense of maintaining his/her dependents elsewhere than at such post. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to regular employees for a separate maintenance allowance not to exceed that made to Aid employees in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 260, as from time to time amended.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(i) <em class="ph i">Payments during evacuation.</em> The Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) provide the authority for efficient, orderly, and equitable procedure for the payment of compensation, post differential and allowances in the event of an emergency evacuation of employees or their dependents, or both, from duty stations for military or other reasons or because of imminent danger to their lives. If evacuation has been authorized by the Mission Director the Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees and authorized dependents evacuated from their post of assignment in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 600, and the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended.
</p>
                                    <p class="p Runin List1">(j) <em class="ph i">Danger pay allowance.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to its employees for danger pay not to exceed that paid USAID employees in the cooperating country, in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 650, as from time to time amended.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) Danger pay is an allowance that provides additional compensation above basic compensation to an employee in a foreign area where civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism or wartime conditions threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the health or well-being of the employee. The danger pay allowance is in lieu of that part of the post differential which is attributable to political violence. Consequently, the post differential may be reduced while danger pay is in effect to avoid dual crediting for political violence.</p>

			The Contractor may grant to its employees working under this contract vacations of reasonable duration in accordance with the Contractor's practice for its employees, but in no event shall such vacation leave be earned at a rate exceeding 26 work days per annum. Reimbursement for vacation leave is limited to the amount earned by employees while serving under this contract.

Additional sick leave after use of accrued vacation leave may be advanced in accordance with Contractor's usual practice, if in the judgment of the Contractor's Chief of Party it is determined that such additional leave is in the best interest of the project. In no event shall such additional leave exceed 30 days. The Contractor agrees to reimburse USAID for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the employee's assignment under this contract.

                                    <p class="p List2">(2) A regular employee who is a U.S. citizen or resident and has served at least 2 years overseas, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this clause, under this contract and has not taken more than 30 workdays leave (vacation, sick, or leave without pay) in the United States, may be granted home leave of not more than 15 workdays for each such year of service overseas, provided that such regular employee agrees to return overseas upon completion of home leave under an additional 2 year appointment, or for a shorter period of not less than 1 year of overseas service under the contract if the Mission Director has approved in advance. Home leave must be taken in the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the possessions of the United States; any days spent elsewhere will be charged to vacation leave or leave without pay.

                                    <p class="p List2">(4) The period of service overseas required under paragraph (c)(2) or paragraph (c)(3) of this clause shall include the actual days spent in orientation in the United States (less language training) and the actual days overseas beginning on the date of departure from the United States port of embarkation on international travel and continuing, inclusive of authorized delays en route, to the date of arrival at the United States port of debarkation from international travel. Allowable vacation and sick leave taken while overseas, but not leave without pay, shall be included in the required period of service overseas. An amount equal to the number of days vacation and sick leave taken in the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the possessions of the United States will be added to the required period of service overseas.

                                    <p class="p List2">(5) Salary during travel to and from the United States for home leave will be limited to the time required for travel by the most expeditious air route. The Contractor will be responsible for reimbursing USAID for salary payments made during home leave if in spite of the undertaking of the new appointment the regular employee, except for reasons beyond his/her control as determined by the contracting officer, does not return overseas and complete the additional required service. Unused home leave is not reimbursable under this contract.
</p>

Consultation at locations other than USAID/Washington or home office/campus, as well as any time in excess of 5 days spent for consultation, must be approved by the Mission Director or the contracting officer.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(7) Except as provided in the schedule or approved by the Mission Director or the contracting officer, home leave is not authorized for TCN or CCN employees.
