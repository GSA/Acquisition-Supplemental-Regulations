</ul></ul></ul></ul><p align="left">1. <u>General</u></p>

<p align="left">(a) <u>Purpose</u>. This appendix sets forth the authority, policy, and procedures under which USAID contracts with cooperating country nationals or third country nationals for personal services abroad.</p>

<p align="left">(b) <u>Definitions</u>. For the purpose of this appendix:</p>

<p align="left">(1) “Personal services contract” (“PSC”) means a contract that, by its express terms or as administered, make the contractor personnel appear, in effect, Government employees (see FAR 37.104).</p>

<p align="left">(2) “Employer-employee relationship” means an employment relationship under a service contract with an individual, which occurs when, as a result of (i) the contract’s terms or (ii) the manner of its administration during performance, the contractor is subject to the relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government officer or employee.</p>

<p align="left">(3) “Non-personal services contract” means a contract under which the personnel rendering the services are not subject either by the contract’s terms or by the manner of its administration, to the supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees.</p>

<p align="left">(4) “Independent contractor relationship” means a contract relationship in which the contractor is not subject to the supervision and control prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees. Under these relationships, the Government does not normally supervise the performance of the work, or the manner in which it is to be performed, control the days of the week or hours of the day in which it is to be performed, or the location of performance.</p>

<p align="left">(5) “Contractor” means a cooperating country national or a third country national who has entered into a contract pursuant to this appendix.</p>

<p align="left">(6) “Cooperating country” means the country in which the employing USAID Mission is located.</p>

<p align="left">(7) “Cooperating country national” (“CCN”) means an individual who is a cooperating country citizen or a non-cooperating country citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the cooperating country.</p>

<p align="left">(8) “Third Country National” (“TCN”) means an individual</p>

<p align="left">(i) who is neither a citizen nor a permanent legal resident alien of the United States nor of the country to which assigned for duty, and</p>

<p align="left">(ii) who is eligible for return to his/her home country or country of recruitment at U.S. Government expense [see  Section 12, General Provision 9 paragraph (n)].</p>

<p align="left">2. <u>Legal Basis</u></p>

<p align="left">(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, hereinafter referred to as the “FAA”, provides the Agency’s contracting authority.</p>

<p align="left">(b) Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA authorizes the Agency to enter into personal services contracts with individuals for personal services abroad and provides further that such individuals “* * * shall not be regarded as employees of the U.S. Government for the purpose of any law administered by the Civil Service Commission.” \1\</p>

<p align="left">\1\ The Civil Service Commission is now the Federal Office of Personnel Management.</p>

<p align="left">3. <u>Applicability</u></p>

<p align="left">(a) This appendix applies to all personal services contracts with CCNs or TCNs to provide assistance abroad under Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA.</p>

<p align="left">(b) This appendix does not apply to:</p>

<p align="left">(1) Contracts for non-personal services with TCNs or CCNs; such contracts are covered by the basic text of the FAR and AIDAR.</p>

<p align="left">(2) Personal services contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens for personal services abroad; such contracts are covered by Appendix D of this chapter.</p>

<p align="left">(3) Appointments of experts and consultants  as USAID direct-hire employees; such appointments are covered by USAID Handbook 25, Employment and Promotion or superseding Chapters of the Automated Directive System (ADS).</p>

<p align="left">(a) <u>General</u>. USAID may finance, with either program or operating expense (OE) funds, the cost of personal services as part of the Agency’s program of foreign assistance by entering into a direct contract with a CCN or a TCN for personal services abroad.</p>

<p align="left">(1) Program funds. Under the authority of Section 636(h) of the FAA, program funds may be obligated for periods up to five years where necessary and appropriate to the accomplishment of the tasks involved.</p>

<p align="left">(2) Operating expense funds. Pursuant to USAID budget policy, OE funded salaries and other recurrent cost items may be forward funded for a period of up to three (3) months beyond the fiscal year in which these funds were obligated. Non-recurring cost items may be forward funded for periods not to exceed twenty-four  (24) months where</p>

<p align="left">necessary and appropriate to accomplishment of the work.\2\</p>

<p align="left">(b) <u>Limitations on Personal Services Contracts</u>.</p>

<p align="left">(1) Personal services contracts may only be used when adequate supervision is available.</p>

<p align="left">(2) Personal services contracts may be used for commercial activities. Commercial activities provide a product or service which could be obtained from a commercial source. See Attachment A of OMB Circular A-76 for a representative list of such activities.</p>

<p align="left">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of USAID directives, regulations or delegations, Cooperating Country or Third Country Nationals may be delegated or assigned any authority, duty or responsibility, delegated or assigned U.S. citizen direct- hire employees (USDH employees) except that:</p>

<p align="left">a. They may not supervise USDH employees of USAID or other</p>

<p align="left"> U.S. Government agencies. They may supervise USPSCs and non-U.S. citizen employees.</p>

<p align="left">b. They may not be designated a Contracting Officer or delegated authority to sign obligating or sub-obligating documents.</p>

<p align="left">c. They may represent the agency, except that communications that reflect a final policy, planning or budget decision of the agency must be cleared by a USDH employee.</p>

<p align="left">d. They may participate in personnel selection matters but may not be delegated authority to make a final decision on personnel selection.</p>

<p align="left">e. Services, which involve security, classified material.</p>

<p align="left">\2\ If there is a need, these contracts may be written for 5 years but only funded as outlined above.</p>

<p align="left">(4) <u>Exceptions</u>. Exceptions to the limitations in (b)(3) must be approved by the Assistant Administrator for Management (AA/M).</p>

<p align="left">(c) <u>Conditions of Employment</u>.</p>

<p align="left">(1) <u>General</u>. For the purpose of any law administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, USAID PSC contractors are not to be regarded as employees of the U.S. Government, are not included under any retirement or pension program of the U.S. Government, and are not eligible for the Incentive Awards Program covered by Uniform State/USAID/USIA regulations. Each USAID Mission is expected to participate in the Joint Special Embassy Incentive  Awards Program. The program is administered by a joint committee which establishes procedures for submission, review and approval of proposed awards. Other than these exceptions, CCNs and TCNs who are hired for work in a cooperating country under PSCs generally will be extended the same benefits and be subject to the same restrictions as Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs) employed as direct-hires by the USAID Mission.</p>

<p align="left">(2) <u>Compensation</u>.</p>

<p align="left">(i) It is USAID’s general policy (see AIDAR 722.170) that PSC compensation may not, without the approval of the Mission Director or Assistant Administrator, exceed the prevailing compensation paid to personnel performing comparable work in the cooperating country. Compensation for TCN or CCN personal services contractors set in accordance with the provisions of 4c(2)(ii) below satisfies this requirement.</p>

<p align="left">(ii) In accordance with Section 408(a)(1) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, a local compensation plan forms the basis for all compensation payments to FSNs which includes CCNs and TCNs. The plan is each post’s official system of position classification and pay, consisting of the local salary schedule which includes salary rates, statements authorizing fringe benefit payments, and other pertinent facets of compensation for TCNs and CCNs, and the local position classification system as reflected in the Local Employee Position Classification Handbook (LEPCH) or equivalent in effect at the Mission.  Compensation for PSCs will be in accordance with the local compensation plan, to the extent that it covers employees of the type or category being employed, unless the Mission Director determines otherwise. If the Mission Director determines that compensation in accordance with the local plan would be inappropriate in a particular instance, then compensation will be set in accordance with (in order of preference):</p>

<p align="left">(A) Any other Mission policies on foreign national employee</p>

<p align="left">compensation; or</p>

<p align="left">(B) Paragraphs 4(c) (d), (e), (g), (h), and (i) of Appendix D. When compensation is set in accordance with this exception, the record shall be documented in writing with a justification prepared by the requesting office and approved by the Mission Director.</p>

<p align="left">(iii) The earning of leave (annual and sick), allowances and differential (if applicable), salaries and all other related benefits cannot be enumerated in this Appendix as they vary from Mission to Mission and are based upon the compensation plan for each.</p>

<p align="left">(iv) Unless otherwise authorized, the currency in which compensation is paid to contractors shall be in accordance with the prevailing local compensation practice of the post.</p>

<p align="left">(v) CCN and TCN contractors are eligible for allowances and differential on the same basis as direct-hire FSN employees under the post compensation plan.</p>

<p align="left">(vi) A USAID PSC who is a spouse of a current or retired U.S. Civil Service, U.S. Foreign Service, or U.S. military service member, and who is covered by their spouse’s government health or life insurance policy, is ineligible for a contribution towards the costs of annual health and life insurance.</p>

<p align="left">(vii) Retired CCNs and TCNs may be awarded personal services contracts without any reduction in or offset against their Government annuity.</p>

<p align="left">(3) <u>Incentives  Awards</u>.</p>

<p align="left">(i) All Cooperating Country Nationals direct-hire and Personal Services Contractors (PSCs) and Third Country Nationals (PSCs) of the Foreign Affairs Community are eligible for the Joint Special Embassy Incentive Awards Program.</p>

<p align="left">(ii) Meritorious Step Increases for USAID FSN PSCs may be authorized provided the granting of such increases is the general practice locally.</p>

<p align="left">(iii) The Joint Country Awards Committee administers each post’s (Embassy) award program, including establishment of procedures for submission, review and approval of proposed awards.</p>

<p align="left">(4) <u>Training</u>. CCN and TCN PSCs are eligible for most of the training courses offered in the Training Course Schedule. However, applications will be processed on a case-by-case basis and are required to be approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p align="left">(a) <u>Technical Officer’s Responsibilities</u>. The Technical Officer will prepare a written detailed statement of duties and a statement of minimum qualifications to cover the position being recruited for; the statement shall be included in the procurement request. The procurement request shall also include the following additional information as a minimum:</p>

<p align="left">(1) The specific foreign location(s) where the work is to be performed, including any travel requirements (with an estimate of frequency);</p>

<p align="left">(2) The length of the contract, with beginning and ending dates, plus any options for renewal or extension;</p>

<p align="left">(3) The basic education, training, experience, and skills required for the</p>

<p align="left">position;</p>

<p align="left">(4) A certification from the officer in the Mission responsible for the LEPCH or equivalent that the position has been reviewed and is properly classified as to a title, series and grade in accordance with the LEPCH. If the position does not fall within the LEPCH or equivalent system, and estimate of compensation based on subparagraphs 4(c)(2)(ii) (A) or (B) of this Appendix after consultations or in coordination with the contract officer or executive officer;</p>

<p align="left">(5) A list of Government or host country furnished items (e.g., housing).</p>

<p align="left">(b) <u>Contracting Officer’s Responsibilities</u>.</p>

<p align="left">(1) The Contracting Officer will prepare the solicitation for personal services which shall contain:</p>

<p align="left">(i) Three sets of certified biographical data and salary history. (Upon receipt, one copy of the above information shall be forwarded to the Project Officer);</p>

<p align="left">(ii) A detailed statement of duties or a completed  position description for the position being recruited for;</p>

<p align="left">(iii) A copy of the prescribed contract Cover Page, Contract Schedule, and General Provisions as well as the FAR Clause to be included in full text and a list of those to be incorporated by reference; and</p>

<p align="left">(iv) A copy of General Notice entitled “Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct” dated October 30, 1992.</p>

<p align="left">(2) The Contracting Officer shall comply with the limitations of AIDAR 706.302-70(c) as detailed in paragraph 5(c) below.</p>

<p align="left">(c) <u>Competition</u>.</p>

<p align="left">(1) Under AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1), Personal Services Contracts are exempt from the requirements for full and open competition with two limitations that must be observed by Contracting Officers:</p>

<p align="left">(i) Offers are to be requested from as many potential offerors as is practicable under the circumstances, and</p>

<p align="left">(ii) a justification supporting less than full and  open competition must be prepared in accordance with FAR 6.303.</p>

<p align="left">(2) A class justification was approved by the USAID Procurement Executive to satisfy the requirements of AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2) for a justification in accordance with FAR 6.303. Use of this class justification for Personal Services</p>

<p align="left">Contracts with Cooperating Country Nationals and Third Country Nationals is subject to the following conditions:</p>

<p align="left">(i) New contracts are publicized consistent with Mission/Embassy practice on announcement of direct hire FSN positions. Renewals or extensions with the same individual for continuing service do not need to be publicized.</p>

<p align="left">(ii) A copy of the class justification (which was distributed to all USAID Contracting Officers via Contract Information Bulletin) must be included in the contract file, together with a written statement, signed by the Contracting Officer, that the contract is being awarded pursuant to AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1); that the conditions for use of this class justification have been met; and that the cost of the contract is fair and reasonable. If the conditions in paragraphs (2)(i) and (ii) are not followed, the Contracting Officer must prepare a separate justification as required under AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2).</p>

<p align="left">(3) Since the award of a personal services contract is based on technical qualifications, not price, and since the biographical data and salary history are used to solicit for such contracts, FAR Subparts 15.4 and 15.5 are inappropriate and shall not be used. Instead, the solicitation and selection procedures outlined in this Appendix shall govern.</p>

<p align="left">6. <u>Negotiating a Personal Services Contract</u></p>

<p align="left"><u><font color="#0000ff"><b><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .http://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/aapds-cibs/cib-93-17. --><a href="http://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/aapds-cibs/cib-93-17">See also CIB 93-17, Financial Disclosure Requirements</a></b></font></u></p>

<p align="left">Negotiating a Personal Services Contract is significantly different from negotiating a non-personal services contract because it establishes an employer- employee relationship; therefore, the selection and negotiations procedures are more akin to the personal selection procedures.</p>

<p align="left">(a) <u>Technical Officer’s Responsibilities</u>. The Technical Officer shall be responsible for reviewing and evaluating the applications received in response to the solicitation issued by the Contracting Officer. If deemed appropriate, interviews may be conducted with the applicants before the final selection is submitted to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p align="left">(b) <u>Contracting Officer’s Responsibilities</u>.</p>

<p align="left">(1) The Contracting Officer shall forward a copy of biographical data and salary history received under the solicitation to the Technical Officer for evaluation.</p>

<p align="left">(2) On receipt of the Technical Officer’s recommendation, the Contracting Officer shall conduct negotiations with the recommended applicant. The terms and conditions of the contract will normally be in accordance with the local compensation plan which forms the basis for all compensation on payments paid to FSNs which includes CCNs and TCNs.</p>

<p align="left">(3) The Contracting Officer shall use the certified salary history on the certified statement of biographical data and salary history as the basis for salary negotiations, along with the Technical Officer’s cost estimate.</p>

<p align="left">(4) The Contracting Officer will obtain necessary data for a security and suitability clearance to the extent required by USAID Handbook 6, Security or superseding ADS Chapters.</p>

<p align="left">(b) A written detailed statement of duties covering the proposed contract has been received;</p>

<p align="left">(c) The proposed scope of work is contractible, contains a statement of minimum qualifications from the technical office requesting the services, and is suitable for a personal services contract in that:</p>

<p align="left">(2) The scope of work does not require performance of any function normally reserved for direct-hire Federal employees (under paragraph 4(b) of this Appendix); and</p>

<p align="left">(3) There is no apparent conflict of interest involved (if the Contracting Officer believes that a conflict of interest may exist, the question should be referred to the cognizant legal counsel);</p>

<p align="left">(d) Selection of the contractor is documented and justified (AIDAR 706.302- 70(b)(1) provides an exception to the requirement for full and open competition for Personal Services Contracts abroad; see paragraph 5(c) of this Appendix);</p>

<p align="left">(e) The standard contract format prescribed for a Cooperating Country National and a Third Country National personal services contract (Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 of this Appendix as appropriate) is used, or that any necessary deviations are processed as required by AIDAR 701.470;</p>

<p align="left">(f) The contractor has submitted the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of at least two persons who may be notified in the event of an emergency (this information is to be retained in the contract file);</p>

<p align="left">(g) The contract is complete and correct and all information required on the contract Cover Page (USAID form 1420-36B) has been entered;</p>

<p align="left">(h) The contract has been signed by the Contracting Officer and the contractor, and fully executed copies are properly distributed;</p>

<p align="left">(i) The following clearances, approvals and forms have been obtained, properly completed, and placed in the contract file before the contract is signed by both parties:</p>

<p align="left">(1) Security clearance to the extent required by USAID Handbook 6, Security or other superseding Chapters of the Automated Directives System;</p>

<p align="left">(2) Mission, host country, and technical office clearance, as appropriate;</p>

<p align="left">(3) Medical clearance(s) based on a full medical examination(s) and statement of medical opinion by a licensed physician. The physician’s medical opinion must be in the possession of the Contracting Officer prior to signature of contract. If a TCN is recruited, medical clearance requirements apply to the contractor and each dependent who is authorized to accompany the contractor;</p>
