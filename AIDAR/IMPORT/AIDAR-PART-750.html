         <p class="p P">The mere fact that losses occur under a Government contract is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for the exercise of the authority conferred by the Executive Order. Whether, in a particular case, appropriate action such as amendment without consideration, correction of a mistake or ambiguity in a contract, or formalization of an informal commitment, will protect the foreign policy interests of the United States is a matter of sound judgment to be made on the basis of all of the facts of such case. Although it is obviously impossible to predict or enumerate all the types of cases with respect to which action may be appropriate, examples of certain cases or types of cases where action may be proper are set forth in sections <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Part_750_T48_501735.html#Section_750_7106_2_T48_501735219">750.7106-2</a> through <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Part_750_T48_501735.html#Section_750_7106_4_T48_5017352111">750.7106-4</a>. Even if all of the factors contained in any of the examples are present, other factors or considerations in a particular case may warrant denial of the request. These examples are not intended to exclude other cases where the approving authority determines that the circumstances warrant action.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Where an actual or threatened loss under a foreign assistance contract, however caused, will impair the productive ability of a contractor whose continued performance of any foreign assistance contract or whose continued operation as a source of supply is found to be essential to protect the foreign policy interests of the United States, the contract may be adjusted but only to the extent necessary to avoid such impairment to the contractor's productive ability.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Where a contractor suffers a loss (not merely a diminution of anticipated profits) on a foreign assistance contract as a result of Government action, the character of the Government action will generally determine whether any adjustment in the contract will be made and its extent. Where the Government action is directed primarily at the contractor and is taken by the Government in its capacity as the other contracting party, the contract may be adjusted if fairness so requires; thus where such Government action, although not creating any liability on its part, increases the cost of performance, considerations of fairness may make appropriate some adjustment in the contract.

         <p class="p P">A contract may be amended or modified to correct or mitigate the effect of a mistake, including the following examples:
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a) A mistake or ambiguity which consists of the failure to express or to express clearly in the written contract the agreements as both parties understood them;
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) A mistake on the part of the contractor which is so obvious that it was or should have been apparent to the contracting officer; and
