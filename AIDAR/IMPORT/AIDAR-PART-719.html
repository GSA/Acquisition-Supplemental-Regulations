         <p class="p List1">(a) In keeping with section 602 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2352), as amended, USAID shall, insofar as practicable and to the maximum extent consistent with the accomplishment of the purposes of said Act, assist U.S. small businesses to participate equitably in the furnishing of supplies and services for Foreign Assistance activities.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) It is the policy of USAID to:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Fully endorse and carry out the Government's small business program for placing a fair proportion of its purchases and contracts for supplies, construction (including maintenance and repair), research and development, and services (including personal, professional, and technical services) with small business, including minority small business concerns; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Increase their participation in USAID procurement.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) In furtherance of this policy:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Contracting officer's representatives shall make positive efforts (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="[rp:link:aidar-part-719]#Section_719_271_5_T48_501416117">719.271-5</a>) to identify potentially qualified small and minority business firms during precontract development of activities and shall, with the responsible contracting officers, assure that such firms are given full opportunity to participate equitably;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Small business set-asides shall be made for all contracts to be executed in USAID/Washington which qualify for small business set-aside action under part 19 of the (48 CFR) FAR; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Consideration shall be given in appropriate cases to the award of the contract to the Small Business Administration for subcontracting to small business firms pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) This program shall be implemented by all USAID/Washington contracting activities in order to attain these policy objectives. In accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="[rp:link:aidar-part-719]#Section_719_271_T48_501416112">719.271</a>, all USAID/Washington direct-procurement requirements which exceed the simplified acquisition threshold shall be screened for small business opportunities by the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) except those exempted by <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="[rp:link:aidar-part-719]#Section_719_271_6_T48_501416118">719.271-6</a>(a).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Where practicable and desirable, small business and minority business enterprise award goals will be established for the respective USAID/Washington procuring activities to provide incentive for contracting personnel to increase awards to small firms. The goals will be set by OSDBU after consultation with the respective head of the contracting activity (see 702-170).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) In the event of a disagreement between OSDBU and the contracting officer concerning: 
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			A recommended set-aside, or (2) a request for modification or withdrawal of a class or individual set-aside, complete documentation of the case including the reasons for disagreement shall be transmitted within five working days to the head of the contracting activity (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="[rp:link:aidar-part-719]#Section_719_271_6_T48_501416118">719.271-6</a>(e)) for a decision. Procurement action shall be suspended pending a decision.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) The above suspension shall not apply where the contracting officer:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Certifies in writing, with supporting information, that in order to protect the public interest award must be made without delay;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Promptly provides a copy of said certification to OSDBU; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Includes a copy of the certification in the contract file.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h) OSDBU shall be the Small Business Advisor and Minority Business Procurement Policy Manager for all USAID/Washington procuring activities.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) The details on the Agency's direction and operation of the small business program are set forth in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="[rp:link:aidar-part-719]#Section_719_271_T48_501416112">719.271</a>.</p>

Small business concerns are defined in (48 CFR) FAR subpart 19.1; in addition, small business concerns are concerns organized for profit. Nonprofit organizations are not considered small business concerns. Small disadvantaged business enterprises are defined in (48 CFR) FAR subpart 19.1. Small disadvantaged business enterprises are included in the term “small business” when used in this subpart; specific reference to disadvantaged business enterprises is for added emphasis.

The Mentor-Protégé Program is also designed to improve the performance of USAID contractors and subcontractors by providing developmental assistance to Protégé entities, fostering the establishment of long-term business relationships between small business and prime contractors, and increasing the overall number of small business that receive USAID contract and subcontract awards. A firm's status as a Protégé under a USAID contract shall not have an effect on the firm's eligibility to seek other prime contracts or subcontracts.

         <p class="p List1">(a) Under the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(E), USAID is authorized to provide appropriate incentives to encourage subcontracting opportunities for small business consistent with the efficient and economical performance of the contract. This authority is limited to negotiated procurements. (48 CFR) FAR 19.202-1 provides additional guidance.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Costs incurred by a Mentor to provide developmental assistance, as described in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="[rp:link:aidar-part-719]#Section_719_273_8_T48_501416219">719.273-8</a> to fulfill the terms of their agreement(s) with a Protégé firm(s), are not reimbursable as a direct cost under a USAID contract. If USAID is the mentor's responsible audit agency under (48 CFR) FAR 42.703-1, USAID will consider these costs in determining indirect cost rates. If USAID is not the responsible audit agency, mentors are encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with their responsible audit agency on the treatment of such costs when determining indirect cost rates.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) In addition to subparagraph (b) above, contracting officers may give Mentors evaluation credit under (48 CFR) FAR 15.101-1 considerations for subcontracts awarded pursuant to their Mentor-Protégé Agreements and their subcontracting plans. Therefore:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Contracting officers may evaluate subcontracting plans containing Mentor-Protégé arrangements more favorably than subcontracting plans without Mentor-Protégé Agreements.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Contracting officers may assess the prime contractor's compliance with the subcontracting plans submitted in previous contracts as a factor in evaluating past performance under (48 CFR) FAR 15.305(a)(2)(v) and determining contractor responsibility (48 CFR) 19.705-5(a)(1).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) OSDBU Mentoring Award. A non-monetary award will be presented annually to the Mentoring firm providing the most effective developmental support of a Protégé. The Mentor-Protégé Program Manager will recommend an award winner to the Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) OSDBU Mentor-Protégé Annual Conference. At the conclusion of each year in the Mentor-Protégé Program, Mentor firms will be invited to brief contracting officers, program leaders, office directors and other guests on Program progress.

Protégés may participate in the Program in pursuit of a prime contract or as subcontractors under the Mentor's prime contract with the USAID, but are not required to be a subcontractor to a USAID prime contractor or be a USAID prime contractor. Notwithstanding eligibility requirements in this section, USAID reserves the right to limit the number of participants in the Program in order to insure its effective management of the Mentor-Protégé Program.
</p>

         <p class="p List2">(1) May be either a large or small business entity;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Must be eligible for award of Government contracts;

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Eligibility.</em> A Protégé:

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Eligible for award of Government contracts.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Protégés may have multiple Mentors. Protégés participating in Mentor-Protégé programs in addition to USAID's Program should maintain a system for preparing separate reports of Mentoring activity so that results of the USAID Program can be reported separately from any other agency program.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) A Protégé firm shall self-certify to a Mentor firm that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section and possess related certifications granted by the Small Business Administration (e.g., HUBZone, 8(a), etc.). Mentors may rely in good faith on written representations by potential Protégés that they meet the specified eligibility requirements. HUBZone and small disadvantaged business status eligibility and documentation requirements are determined according to 13 CFR part 124.
