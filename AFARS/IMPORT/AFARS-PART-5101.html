<p class="List1">(a) <em>DoD peer reviews</em>. </p>
<p class="List2">(1)<em>  </em>The SCO will concur, in writing, on all solicitation and contract packages submitted for each phase of any DoD peer review and provide a copy to the HCA. <a href="https://spcs3.kc.army.mil/asaalt/procurement/PGI/PGI_5101.aspx">See AFARS PGI 5101.170-2</a>.</p>

<p class="List1">(b) <em>Component peer reviews.</em></p>
<p class="List3">(i) <em>Army peer reviews.</em> With the exception of acquisitions using sealed bidding procedures (see FAR Part 14), a Solicitation Review Board (SRB) and a Contract Review Board (CRB) will approve all procurements with an estimated value of $50 million or more including the award of task and delivery orders. The SCO will establish a threshold for when a CRB is required for contract modifications that increase total evaluated price or otherwise increase scope. A CRB is not required for modifications that exercise an option or add incremental funding. The SRB and CRB will be comprised of senior level experts from teams not directly involved with the procurement being reviewed. These multi-functional teams will include, at a minimum, representatives from the contracting activity, small business office, office of counsel, requirements community, and the advocate for competition, as applicable. The same representatives should participate in both the SRB and the CRB to ensure consistency.</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) <em>Objective of Army peer reviews.</em> The SRB/CRB will review and assess the presolicitation, solicitation and contract award documents for consistency, sufficiency, compliance and application of sound business practices. The SRB/CRB will verify that the procurement represents an overall good value to the Government and appropriate obligation of taxpayer funds.</p>
<p class="List3">(iii) <em>Resolution of comments.</em> The SCO will establish procedures for resolving all SRB and CRB comments.</p>
<p class="List3">(iv) <em>Peer review statistics.  </em>Contracting activities will collect peer review statistics, to include annual data on the number of SRB/CRB reviews conducted or waived, identification of any systemic issues or trends, best practices, lessons learned, overall effectiveness of the process, and other data as determined necessary. </p>

<p class="List2">(2) The DASA(P) will customize the departmental review requirements on a case-by-case basis.. </p>

SCOs will work with local chief counsels, or equivalent official, to develop specific legal review protocols that are consistent with this provision.</p>
<p class="List1">(c) Obtain legal reviews on proposed actions to determine if the action is legally sufficient based on statute, regulation, and policy, and request details and a recommended course of action to resolve any insufficiency.
