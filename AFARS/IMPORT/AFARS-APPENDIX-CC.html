<p class="List1">(a) PMR reviews by the Office of the DASA(P) (ODASA(P)) to Army Headquarters offices for contracting, Army contracting Commands/Activities, and Offices of the Senior Contracting Official (OSCOs).

<p class="List1">(c) PMR reviews by the Directors of Contracting to subordinate contracting offices.</p>
