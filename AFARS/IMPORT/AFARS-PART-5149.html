<p class="List2">(1) The contracting officer shall send to the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (ODASA(P)) notifications of significant contract terminations &ndash;</p>
<p class="List3">(i) As soon as the contracting officer identifies a potential full or partial termination; and</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) Once the contracting officer has made a final decision to terminate. </p>
<p class="List2">(2) The contracting officer is not authorized to release any termination notice or any information concerning the proposed significant contract termination until the Office of the Chief Legislative Liaison clears the termination notice. The ODASA(P) will coordinate notification with the Office of the Chief Legislative Liaison. ODASA(P) will then notify the contracting officer whether the action is cleared for termination.</p>
<p class="List2">(3) The contracting officer shall send termination notifications in the format in DFARS PGI 249.7001. Send the unclassified notices through the senior contracting official (SCO) to the address at AFARS 5101.290(b)(2)(ii)(C).</p>

Contracting officers and SCOs shall ensure the Secretary of Labor notice arrives at ODASA(P) with sufficient time for ODASA(P) to process and send the notice to the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<p class="List3">(iv) If both DFARS 249.7001 and 249.7003 apply, the timing requirements of 249.7003 may necessitate release of the 249.7003(b)(2) notification before the 249.7001 notification. In such cases, the contracting officer shall provide the DFARS 249.7003(b)(2) notices within the required timeframe, but shall not provide the contractor with other information on the anticipated termination until the requirements at DFARS 249.7001 and 5149.7001 have been satisfied.</p>
