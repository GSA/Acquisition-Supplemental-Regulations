<a id="P4_68"></a><a id="_Toc512860932"></a>Part 1 &ndash; Introduction</h3>
<h4 class="Heading4">
<a id="P5_90"></a><a id="_Toc512860933"></a>DD-100 Purpose.</h4>
<p class="NormalWeb">The guide provides a methodology for uniform and consistent evaluation of subcontracting plans within the Army. It is designed to facilitate compliance with the mandates of 15 U.S.C. &sect; 637(d) to increase opportunities for small and small disadvantaged businesses.</p>
<h4 class="Heading4">
<a id="P7_361"></a><a id="_Toc512860934"></a>DD-101 Applicability.</h4>
<p class="NormalWeb">In accordance with requirements of FAR 19.705-4, DFARS 219.705-4 and AFARS 5119.705-4, the contracting officer shall use this guide to review all subcontracting plans (except those for commercial items), including those submitted in response to the provisions in FAR 19.705-2(d) and (e). When the contract will require subcontracting plans, use the clauses designated by FAR 19.708(b)(1) and (2) and DFARS 219.708(b)(1)(A) in the solicitation.<span style="color:#FF0000 !important">  </span>A copy of the completed evaluation shall be included in the contract file.</p>
<h4 class="Heading4">
<a id="P9_790"></a><a id="_Toc512860935"></a>DD-102 Goals.</h4>
<p class="NormalWeb">Contracting officers must place special emphasis on negotiating subcontracting<span style="color:#FF0000 !important"> </span>goals that are realistic, challenging and attainable. The plan must express goals in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars and must be comparable to the dollar commitments in the small business participation plan. In accordance with FAR 19.705-4(d), the contracting officer must review enough evidence to determine that the:</p>
<p class="NormalWeb">1. Offeror can meet subcontracting plan goals;</p>
<p class="NormalWeb">2. Offeror&rsquo;s goals are consistent with their cost or pricing data or information other than cost or pricing data;</p>
<p class="NormalWeb">3. Offeror will honor the terms of subcontract agreements (i.e., timely payments of amounts owed, use of firms cited in proposal, etc.); and</p>
<p class="NormalWeb">4. Offeror&rsquo;s make or buy policy or program does not conflict with the proposed subcontracting plan and is in the Government&rsquo;s best interest.</p>
<p class="NormalWeb">5. Plan includes the contractor&rsquo;s commitment to adopt and comply with its requirements and goals for small business utilization.</p>
<h4 class="Heading4">
<a id="P11_1130"></a><a id="_Toc512860936"></a>DD-103 Evaluation Rating.</h4>
<p class="NormalWeb">Either the contracting officer, the small business representative, or both, shall evaluate and rate the subcontracting plan as &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; or &ldquo;unacceptable,&rdquo; in the context of the particular procurement. For instance, in smaller dollar value contracts, or contracts for uniquely manufactured items, it might be impracticable or not cost effective for offerors to take the type of actions that might be appropriate in contracts for larger dollar values or commercial components. To receive an &ldquo;Acceptable&rdquo; rating, the contractor must satisfy all objectives in Part 2 and meet each statutory subcontracting plan requirement outlined in Part 3. Failure to receive a subcontracting plan rating of acceptable could jeopardize the offeror&rsquo;s selection for contract award. The contracting officer must document the decisions in the contract file.</p>
<h4 class="Heading4">
<a id="P13_1621"></a><a id="_Toc512860937"></a>DD-104 Modification of Guide.</h4>
<p class="NormalWeb">Pursuant to AFARS 5101.403, only senior contracting officials may approve individual deviations to this evaluation guide.<span style="color:#FF0000 !important">  </span>This approval authority may not be further delegated.</p>
<h4 class="Heading4">
<a id="P15_1792"></a><a id="_Toc512860938"></a>DD-105 Use of Preaward Surveys.</h4>
<p class="NormalWeb">For contracts administered by the Defense Contract Management Agency, obtain information needed to assess contractor compliance with subcontracting plans in current and previous contracts by requesting a preaward survey in accordance with FAR 9.106, DFARS 209.106 and DFARS PGI 209.106.</p>
<h3 class="Heading3">
<a id="P17_2088"></a><a id="_Toc512860939"></a>Part 2 &ndash; Rating System</h3>
<h4 class="Heading4">
<a id="_Toc512860940"></a>DD-201 Acceptable Plans.</h4>
<p class="NormalWeb">Objective: The subcontracting plan meets all of the requirements outlined in Part 3. The offeror has provided details that demonstrate an acceptable approach to assisting, promoting and utilizing small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, historically underutilized business zone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and, for Defense Research Programs, historically black colleges and universities and minority serving institutions. The offeror has demonstrated an ability to meet prior subcontracting plan goals and honor the terms of subcontract agreements. Offeror has outlined an approach utilizing mentor prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms, joint venture teams, or other partners. The subcontracting goals are realistic, challenging, and attainable. Clarifications and minor rework of the submission may be required to correct slight omissions that do not prejudice other offers.</p>
<h4 class="Heading4">
<a id="_Toc512860941"></a>DD-202 Unacceptable Plans.</h4>
<p class="NormalWeb">Objective: The subcontracting plan fails to meet a requirement outlined in Part 3. The offeror has not provided an acceptable approach to assisting, promoting, and utilizing small businesses. The offeror has a history of failing to honor subcontract agreements. The offeror did not discuss the establishment of mentor prot&eacute;g&eacute; relationships, teaming, or joint venture agreements with other firms. Ensure the proposed subcontracting goals are attainable in light of the contractor&rsquo;s past performance in meeting subcontracting goals. Proposed subcontracting goals reflect less than a good faith effort. Substantial rework of the document is required to correct omissions and establish realistic, challenging, and attainable goals. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable may jeopardize offeror&rsquo;s eligibility for contract award. See FAR 19.702(a)(1).</p>
<h3 class="Heading3">
