<p>The Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS) implements and supplements the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) and the DFARS Procedures, Guidance and Information (PGI) to establish uniform policies for Army acquisition. It does not restrict the exercise of good business judgment or stifle innovation.</p>

<p>(b) <em>Delegation of authority.  </em>Each authority is delegable within the contracting chain of authority unless otherwise indicated by law, statute, or regulation. All delegations must reference the applicable AFARS citation. Delegations that do not include expiration dates remain effective until a higher authority supersedes or cancels them. </p>

<p><span style="color:#auto">Delegations of certain procurement authorities are identified throughout the AFARS with a pointer to a matrix, labeled Appendix GG.   Appendix GG outlines all delegations of authority within the FAR, DFARS and AFARS, and specifies whether the authority prohibits or allows for further delegation.

<p>(a) <em>DoD peer reviews</em>. </p>
<p>(1)<em>  </em>The SCO will concur, in writing, on all solicitation and contract packages submitted for each phase of any DoD peer review. For the first phase only, the SCO will send a copy of the written concurrence to the DASA(P) (see 5101.290) and provide a copy to the head of the contracting activity (HCA).</p>
<p>(i) In accordance with <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/policy/policyvault/Class_Deviation_2019-O0010-DPC.pdf">Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC) Class Deviation 2019-O0010, Peer Reviews of Contracts for Supplies and Services</a>, except for procurements of major defense acquisition programs above $1 billion for which the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&amp;S)) is the milestone decision authority and USD(A&amp;S) special interest programs, the DASA(P) is responsible for conducting preaward peer reviews for competitive procurements above $1 billion. See Appendix GG for further delegation.</p>
<p>(2) Contracting activities shall provide their rolling annual forecast of acquisitions that will be subject to DoD peer reviews to the address at 5101.290(b)(2)(ii)(A) at the end of each quarter. See 5104.802(f)(4) for peer review forecast requirements.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Component peer reviews.</em></p>
<p>(i) <em>Army peer reviews.</em> With the exception of acquisitions using sealed bidding procedures (see FAR Part 14), a Solicitation Review Board (SRB) and a Contract Review Board (CRB) will approve all procurements with an estimated value of $50 million or more including the award of task and delivery orders. A CRB is required for contract modifications that increase total evaluated price or otherwise increase scope. A CRB is not required for modifications that exercise an option, add incremental funding, or make administrative changes. The SRB and CRB will be independent, multi-functional teams comprised of senior level experts, which will, at a minimum, include representatives from the contracting activity, small business office, office of counsel, requirements community, and in the case of noncompetitive actions, the advocate for competition. The same members should participate in both the SRB and the CRB in order to ensure consistency.</p>
<p>(ii) <em>Objective of Army peer reviews.</em> The SRB/CRB will review and assess the presolicitation, solicitation and contract award documents for consistency, sufficiency, compliance and application of sound business practices. The SRB/CRB will verify that the procurement represents an overall good value to the Government and appropriate obligation of taxpayer funds.</p>
<p>(iii) <em>Resolution of comments.</em> The SCO will establish procedures for resolving all SRB and CRB comments.</p>
<p>(iv) <em>Peer review statistics.  </em>Contracting activities will collect peer review statistics, to include annual data on the number of SRB/CRB reviews conducted and waived, identification of any systemic issues or trends, best practices, lessons learned, overall effectiveness of the process, and other data as determined necessary. </p>
<p>(v) <em>Preaward peer reviews for competitive procurements valued at less than $1 billion and noncompetitive procurements valued at less than $500 million.</em></p>
<p>(A) The HCA will chair an SRB and a CRB for:</p>
<p>(<em>1</em>) Competitive procurements valued at $250 million or more but less than $1 billion or</p>
<p>(<em>2</em>) Noncompetitive procurements valued at $250 million or more but less than $500 million. See Appendix GG for further delegation.</p>
<p>(B) The SCO will chair an SRB and a CRB for all procurements valued at $50 million or more but less than $250 million. See Appendix GG for further delegation.</p>
<p>(C) The contracting activity&rsquo;s business clearance process (see 5115.406) normally satisfies the oversight function of peer reviews for acquisitions below $50 million. If the SCO determines, in accordance with a risk-based analysis, that a separate peer review is necessary for an acquisition valued below $50 million, the SCO or designee shall conduct the peer review consistent with the procedures set forth for Army peer reviews in this section.</p>
<p>(D) HCAs, SCOs and chiefs of the contracting office may waive the requirement for a formal review board. The contracting officer will include the written waiver in the contract file.</p>
<p>(vi) <em>Postaward peer reviews of contracts for services valued at less than $1 billion.</em></p>
<p>(A) At least once during the period of performance the HCA will conduct a postaward peer review for contracts for services valued at $250 million or more but less than $1 billion. See Appendix GG for further delegation. The information identified in 5137.590-6(a)(8) and 5137.590-7 will serve as the starting point for the postaward reviews. For such reviews, the HCA will provide the Senior Services Manager a postaward peer review summary report. The summary report will address the postaward peer review of service requirements focus areas at DFARS PGI 201.170-3(b) and the postaward peer review required elements at DFARS PGI 201.170-4, and shall be submitted to the email address at 5101.290(b)(2)(ii)(F) no later than 60 days after completion of the review.</p>
<p>(B) The SCO will establish procedures for postaward peer reviews for contracts for services valued at $50 million or more but less than $250 million.</p>
<p> (S-90) If the DASA(P) identifies a procurement as special interest, the ODASA(P) will convene an HQDA review of the procurements. The DASA(P) will serve as the chairperson. Other Army peer reviews identified in 5101.170(b) are not required when the ODASA(P) conducts a special interest peer review for a procurement.</p>

<p>(a)(1) Contracting activities will obtain either head of the contracting activity (HCA) or, if delegated, SCO concurrence on all procurement document packages submitted for Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) review, coordination, and/or approval. The SCO may not delegate this authority. Procurement document packages will include all reviews and coordination completed prior to submission to HQDA, including legal reviews. Unless otherwise specified in this regulation, individual and class deviations to this AFARS provision are prohibited. Send document packages via the HQDA Task Management Tool (TMT) to the ODASA(P) pillar groups associated with the email addresses listed in 5101.290(b)(2)(ii)(C) (except as provided elsewhere in this regulation). </p>
<p>(2) The contracting officer shall include the contract type determination required by FAR 16.103(d)(1) and 5116.103(d)(1) in HQDA-level approval packages that reference contract type, including the approvals required by FAR 6.304 and FAR 16.504(c)(1)(D)(<em>1</em>). If a written acquisition plan is required for the associated contract action, include the acquisition plan in the submission package and provide the acquisition plan citation in the applicable paragraph of the document submitted for review. If a written acquisition plan is not required, include the contract type determination from the contract file in the submission package.</p>

<p>(a) <em>Definitions</em>. As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) &ldquo;Acquisition instruction&rdquo; means the set of governing local processes and procedures developed and maintained by the head of each contracting activity.</p>
<p>(2) &ldquo;Policy&rdquo; means direction to contracting organizations implementing statute, executive order, regulation, or other governing directives.</p>
<p>(3) &ldquo;Procedure&rdquo; means an outline of how to perform a process &ndash; who performs what action, what sequence they perform the steps in the task, and the criteria (i.e., standard) they must meet to accomplish the goal/end-state.</p>
<p>(4) &ldquo;Process&rdquo; means a high-level view or map of the tasks required by the policy described in sufficient detail to direct the user to a desired outcome.</p>
<p>(b) All Army procurement policy is centralized under the ODASA(P), and ODASA(P) is the only Army organization authorized to issue procurement policy.</p>
<p>(c) HQDA and Army contracting activities will not supplement the FAR, DFARS, or AFARS or issue internal acquisition regulations or instructions except as provided in this section. HCAs, on a non-delegable basis, are responsible for procurement processes and procedures, to include processes and procedures intended for issuance below the HCA level, within their contracting activity. These shall be codified in an acquisition instruction. HCAs shall obtain DASA(P) approval for their baseline acquisition instruction. HCAs are to maintain, review, and update their acquisition instruction as necessary.</p>
<p>(1) Acquisition instructions require recurring certification by the Procurement Policy Pillar. The Procurement Policy Pillar shall evaluate the integrity of the acquisition instruction to ensure compliance with established procurement policies, procedures, and regulations. All substantive issues shall be resolved prior to recertification of the acquisition instruction. </p>
<p>(2) The first recertification evaluation shall be conducted in fiscal year 2022 between the months of January and March and every three years thereafter. HCAs shall submit their acquisition instruction for review to the DASA(P) in accordance with 5101.290(b)(2)(ii)(A). </p>

<p>At any time during the procurement process, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Procurement (DASA(P)) may direct the responsible SCO or source selection authority to submit a proposed contractual action to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) for review, notation, and/or approval. The SCO or source selection authority will provide any information, documents, and briefings requested, and will not take, or permit anyone else to take, final action on the proposed contractual action during the period of the DASA(P) review. In accordance with FAR 3.104-4(a), the ASA(ALT) has authorized personnel within the Office of the DASA(P), the Office of the Army General Counsel, and other personnel designated by the DASA(P) to receive full access to contractor bid or proposal information and source selection information in connection with such review.</p>

<p>Contracting officers will obtain a legal review and consider counsel&rsquo;s advice as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Include legal counsel as a member of the acquisition team (see FAR <span style="color:#000000">1.102-3) </span>throughout the acquisition process;</p>
<p>(b) Obtain a legal review for proposed contracting actions in accordance with locally established procedures and as otherwise required by law, regulation, or policy. It is not practicable to specify, in the AFARS, an inclusive list of actions requiring legal review at each contracting activity. Instead, counsel will routinely review a full range of acquisition-related actions that have potential legal significance. SCOs will work with local chief counsels, or equivalent official, to develop specific legal review protocols that are consistent with this provision.</p>
<p>(c) Obtain legal reviews on proposed actions to determine if the action is legally sufficient based on statute, regulation, and policy, and request details and a recommended course of action to resolve any insufficiency. Contracting officers will address and resolve counsel&rsquo;s objections at the lowest possible level. Contracting officers and counsel will elevate unresolved objections within the acquisition and legal channels, as appropriate, and in exceptional cases, to the head of the contracting activity (HCA).</p>
<p>(d) The contracting officer, under SCO direction, retains sole authority to determine matters that relate to the exercise of business judgment.</p>

Contracting officers shall execute the COR appointment in the DoD Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) Joint Appointment Module (JAM) no later than one business day after receipt of the contract in the Electronic Data Access (EDA) system has been confirmed. </p>
<p>(b) Contracting officers will allow 45 calendar days after receipt of the procurement request (PR) package for the requiring activity (RA) to satisfy all COR requirements. If, after the 45 days, a COR has not been properly trained and nominated in PIEE JAM, contracting officers will cease further action on the PR package and return it to the supported RA. </p>
<p>(c) Contracting officers will validate COR and ordering officer records every 12 months in accordance with DFARS PGI 201.602-2(d)(vii) to ensure contractor compliance with the terms of the contract. Contracting officers will document the review in the contract file.</p>
