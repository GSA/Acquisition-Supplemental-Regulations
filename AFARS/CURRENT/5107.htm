<p>(B) Procurements for foreign military sales (see DFARS 225.73), other than procurements funded with U.S. appropriated funds, are exempt from the requirements at DFARS 207.103(d)(i) to prepare a written acquisition plan, when?</p>
<p>(1) An International Agreement Competitive Restrictions (ICAR) has been approved IAW 5106.302-4(c); or</p>
<p>(2) The procurement is for an item of standard Army material (i.e., supplies that, as confirmed by the requiring activity, have been type classified  standard  under Army Regulation 700-142, Type Classification, Material Release, Fielding, and Transfer) for which other acquisition planning documentation exists and can be documented in the contract file.</p>
<p>(ii) When there is not a requirement for a written acquisition plan, or the approval authority has waived the requirements of formality and detail in exceptional cases, use an alternate format or contract documentation such as memoranda for record, price negotiation memoranda, simplified acquisition management plan, and acquisition strategies (for service requirements) to record acquisition pre-award decisions and risk assessment information. Contracting officers shall maintain such decision support information in the contract file and to the extent practicable avoid duplication of information between the services acquisition strategy (see 5137.590-6) and the acquisition plan (e.g., by referencing content).</p>
<p>(m) Only the acquisition plan approval authority may waive requirements of detail and formality.</p>
<h4 id="acquisition-plan-approvals.">5107.103-90 Acquisition plan approvals.</h4>

<p>(1) For programs assigned to program executive officers (PEOs) or program managers reporting directly to the Army Acquisition Executive (DRPM), the designated milestone decision authority (MDA), on a nondelegable basis, is the acquisition plan approval authority.

<p>(2) For all non-PEO/direct-reporting program manager acquisitions, the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) is the acquisition plan approval authority. See Appendix GG for further delegation.</p>
<p>(b) Approval of acquisition plans for procurements below the thresholds identified at DFARS 207.103(d)(i) shall be in accordance with contracting activity procedures.</p>
<p>(c) For Army Acquisition Executive-designated special interest acquisitions, the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) or the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) must approve the acquisition plans. Process acquisition plans for special interest acquisitions in the same manner as other acquisition plans and include all the concurrences listed in paragraph (c).</p>

<p>(iii) These procedures should allow sufficient time for development of an acquisition plan; preparation of solicitations, including any necessary coordination with requiring and technical elements; receipt and evaluation of bids or proposals; audits; negotiation; boards or business clearance reviews; source selection and preparation of contractual documents in an orderly and timely manner.</p>
<p>(iv) HCAs should establish due dates for submission of procurement requests requiring action by the end of the fiscal year to the contracting office. Exceptions to established due dates must be minimized and require authorization at a level not lower than the chief of the contracting office.</p>
<p>(v) In acquisitions where sole source approvals are necessary, acquisition planning must provide appropriate opportunities for the following:</p>
<p>(A) Involving Defense Contract Management Agency and Defense Contract Audit Agency early in the acquisition process.</p>
<p>(B) Obtaining appropriate contractor input for use in the development of the acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>(C) Establishing a Government and contractor team, including individuals with execution responsibility as well as reviewers, committed on a real-time basis to streamline the acquisition process and maintain open communications.</p>
<p>(D) Teaming of Government and contractor personnel in development of the proposal and model contract, leading to agreement on contractor effort and costs associated with the task(s).</p>
<p>(E) Teaming of the Government and contractor personnel during post-award contract performance to improve communications and develop efficient contract administration.</p>
