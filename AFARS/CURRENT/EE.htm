        Chapter 1: The Government Purchase Card Program</h1>
    <h2 id="purpose">1-1. Purpose</h2>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>This document provides the procedures to be used within the Army to establish and manage the Army Government Purchase Card (GPC) program. Best practices are identified in Appendix A. Army activities may adopt more stringent internal control requirements than the requirements cited herein. However, as these are risk-managed programs, activities should maintain a proper balance between the control environment and ease of use to ensure that the benefits of the card continue to accrue. These procedures establish Army-wide standards designed to provide all Army activities with a foundation upon which to build specific standard operating procedures governing their programs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Nonappropriated activities implement policies and procedures governing the Army s morale, welfare, and recreation programs and general policies on Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI). Chaplaincy activities implement policies and procedures governing Army Chaplain Corps activities. Army NAFIs/entities must operate within the parameters of these procedures.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="glossary">1-2. Glossary</h2>
    <p>Acronyms and special terms are in the Glossary, Appendix J.</p>
    <h2 id="background">1-3. Background</h2>
    <p>The General Services Administration (GSA) awarded a multiple award schedule contract for U.S. Government commercial purchase card services. The contractor (hereinafter referred to as the Servicing Bank ) provides commercial GPCs and associated services. The Army issues a task order to the servicing bank for its GPC services.</p>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>The Chief of the Contracting Office (CCO) shall delegate micro-purchase procurement authority to individuals at the lowest level in accordance with FAR Part 1-603-3(b). This authority may be redelegated in writing to the Level 3 or 4 Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC). Sample appointment letters are located at Appendix F.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Orientation and training on the Army purchase card program is a prerequisite to receiving a GPC.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Generally, only government employees can be cardholders. However, a number of exceptions apply:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>
                    <p>Under certain conditions, GSA can authorize contractors to establish cards directly with the issuing bank, if necessary. (DOD Guidebook page A-1). Requests for GPC by contractors working under cost type contracts shall be forwarded to the Army contracting officer for the cost-reimbursable contract. If the contracting officer determines that the contractors are eligible, the contractors must file a Request for Eligibility Determination with the GSA SmartPay contracting officer. (AFARS 5113.202-90(b)).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Foreign nationals may be designated as accountable officials - Billing Officials (BOs) and Cardholders (CHs) provided they are direct hires, even though they may not be subject to pecuniary liability under U.S. law. Given the above, purchase cards may be issued to foreign national employees of the Army if they meet accountable official requirements (nomination and training). They are subject to the same disciplinary actions for card misuse as U.S. citizen employees, subject to host country agreements and local law. (DOD Guidebook page A-1 and DOD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 33, paragraph 330204)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) Instructors are members of the Armed Forces in accordance with AR 145-2, paragraph 4-3, and may be designated micro-purchase procurement authority as GPC cardholders. (FAR Part 1-603-3(b))</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Army cardholders who are ordering officers may be authorized to use the GPC as a payment instrument for orders made against Federal Supply Schedule contracts (FSS), Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), DOD Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts that contain a provision authorizing payment by purchase card, or other contracts when authorized by the contracting officer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The GPC may provide a streamlined way of paying for contracts and other contracts than those listed above, but a contracting officer shall first determine that use of the GPC is in the best interest of the government (AFARS 5113.202-90(d)). See FAR Subpart 32.1110(d) and 32.1108 for instructions for use of the appropriate clause when payment under a written contract is made through use of the card. If payment under a written contract is made by the GPC, then the contracting officer shall insert the FAR clause 52.232-36, Payment by Third Party, in solicitations and contracts. Payment by a purchase card may also be made under a contract that does not contain the clause at 52.232-36, to the extent the contractor agrees to accept that method of payment. When the clause at 52.232-36 is included in a solicitation or contract, the contracting officer shall also insert the clause at 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer?Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer?Other Than Central Contractor Registration, as appropriate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The maximum single transaction dollar limit for the GPC for stand-alone purchases shall be the micro-purchase threshold as defined at FAR 2.101, DFARS 213.301(2) and AFARS 5113.270-90. The maximum single transaction dollar limit for contract payments against existing contracts shall be as identified in the contract and shall be within the limits defined in the CH written Delegation of Authority letter or the contracting officer s warrant. In the event of an emergency need for contingency or humanitarian aid operations, the Executive Office of the President may sign into law an emergency procurement authority allowing increased GPC and convenience check limits and revised procedures in support of contingency and humanitarian aid operations. In such circumstances, the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy also may authorize class deviations to allow organizations to deviate from the FAR and DFARS. Such deviations may include raising GPC spending limits. These contingency/emergency purchases require separate training and Delegation of Authority by the A/OPC on contingency/emergency procedures and authority must be issued/granted by the Chief of Contracting or other authorized person.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The GPC shall be used to pay for government-owned material or government-performed services received from other government sources (e.g. Defense Logistics Agency Document Services, GSA Global, and Defense Logistics Agency).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The GPC shall be used as a method of payment for all commercial training $25,000 and below. The Standard Form (SF) 182 must be completed for training up to $25,000. If training costs exceed $25,000, submit the training requirement to your local contracting office. A separate and dedicated training GPC card must be issued and used to purchase training. These GPC training cards are only used to purchase training requirements.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Where it is identified that the purchase is processed via a third party merchant (such as PayPal), the CH should make every attempt to choose another merchant with whom to procure the goods and/or services. If found necessary to procure using a third party payment merchant, the BO must ensure adequate supporting documentation showing that there was a detailed review of the purchase and that the use of the third party payment merchant was unavoidable.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="section"></h2>
    <h2 id="applicability">1-6. Applicability</h2>
    <p>These procedures apply to all GPC purchases with cards issued by the Army. Non-Army tenant organizations issued Army GPCs or convenience checks by an Army contracting office are also subject to these procedures. All BOs, CHs, A/OPCs (at all levels), Resource Managers (RMs), Logisticians, and other stakeholders that participate in the GSA SmartPay Purchase Card Program under the Army Level 2 hierarchy are subject to these procedures. The policy established in this document supersedes previous guidance issued in the Draft Army Regulation (AR715-xx). Explanation of the Army level hierarchy is provided at 1-8.</p>
    <h2 id="program-organization-roles-and-responsibilities">1-7. Program Organization, Roles and Responsibilities </h2>
    <p>The general roles and responsibilities of the participants in the purchase card program are presented in the references listed in paragraph 1-4 and the following: AFARS 5113.201, Chapter 2 and Appendix A of the DOD Government Charge Card Guidebook; Volume 1, Part 4, Chapter 4500 of the Treasury Financial Manual; Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular 123, Appendix B Revised, Chapters 4.3, 4.4, and 4.8; 31 U.S.C. 3528 Responsibilities and Relief from Liability of Certifying Officials; DOD Financial Management Regulation (DOD FMR) Volume 5, Chapter 33 Departmental Accountable Officials, Certifying Officers and Review Officials , and DOD FMR Volume 10, Chapter 23, paragraph 2303 and 2304.</p>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>Responsibility for the establishment and operation of an agency s GPC program is delegated to the agency s Senior Contracting Official (SCO). The SCO, or in activities that do not have a SCO, the Chief of the Contracting Office (CCO), designates a Level 3 A/OPC and an alternate(s) who once appointed is dedicated to the GPC Program within their agency/organization.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The SCO or CCO forwards the Level 3 A/OPC Appointment Letter to the Level 2 A/OPC using the template found at Appendix F. The letter delegates responsibility for managing the agency GPC program and details responsibilities, training and certification requirements, and grade level preferences for the Level 3 A/OPC role. The Level 2 A/OPC reviews the nomination and ensures the Level 3 A/OPC meets all requirements of the position. Once approved, the Level 2 A/OPC provides written endorsement and coordinates Level 3 A/OPC appointment with the servicing bank. The Level 2 A/OPC is the final approval authority for agency Level 3 A/OPC appointments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>SCOs must ensure adequate resources are dedicated to the GPC program within their agency/organization to ensure successful management of the program. Adequate GPC resources refer to an agency s efficient and effective deployment of assets (such as number of personnel, training, funding, facilities, knowledge and skills, etc.) when and where needed to meet agency requirements in compliance with the laws and regulations governing the GPC Program. Adequate resources must be deployed to reasonably ensure that programs achieve their intended results; resources are used consistent with agency mission; programs and resources are protected from fraud, waste, and mismanagement; laws and regulations are followed; and reliable and timely information is obtained, maintained, reported and used for decision making.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Individuals meeting the following criteria may be appointed as Level 3 or 4 A/OPCs for the GPC Program; GPC knowledge, training, and experience, basic contracting knowledge and/or acquisition training. The Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) requires the Department of Defense to establish education and training standards, requirements, and courses for the civilian and military workforce. The DAWIA certification requirements are located at <a href="https://dap.dau.mil/career/pur/Pages/Certification.aspx">DAU Certification Requirements</a>. DAWIA contracting or purchasing certification includes a training, education, and experience requirement. The Army requires Level 3 and Level 4 A/OPCs to be DAWIA Level II certified in contracting. A/OPCs that are not DAWIA Level 2 certified in contracting must either complete the DAWIA Level 2 contracting training requirement within 24 months or achieve DAWIA Level 2 certification in purchasing within 24 months of being assigned to the Level 3 or Level 4 A/OPC position. This requirement is effective immediately upon appointment of all A/OPCs. Although the Level 3 A/OPC position typically warrants a minimum equivalent grade of GS-13 or higher, the grade depends on the responsibilities, complexity, and volume of the program. In addition to certification requirements, Level 3 and 4 A/OPCs are required to have completed the training requirements detailed in Section 2-2.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The SCO management responsibility authority for the GPC Program is further delegated to the CCO. The CCO must ensure adequate resources are dedicated to the GPC program within their installation/activity to allow effective administration of the program. The CCO coordinates with the local personnel office(s) to ensure procedures are established requiring individuals involved in the GPC Program to clear through the Level 4 A/OPC when they out-process from the installation. The Level 4 A/OPC is appointed at a sufficient grade/rank to exercise their authority depending on the responsibilities, complexity, and volume of the program. Only individuals who meet the criteria in paragraphs 1-8(d) may be appointed as A/OPCs for the GPC Program.</p>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>Nomination, selection, and appointment of CHs and BOs are in accordance with AFARS Part 5113. The nominating official must be in the supervisory chain of the individual being nominated. CHs, BOs, and Checkwriters must be issued written authority identifying their limits of authority, duties, responsibilities, credit limits, and the written authority must reference mandatory compliance with the AFARS Subpart 5113.2 and the Army Government Purchase Card Operating Procedures. The BO, or CH will acknowledge receipt (electronic signature and date permissible) of appointment letters. Warranted contracting officers do not require a separate delegation of authority to use the GPC.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The CH is also a Departmental Accountable Official (DAO) according to paragraph 3305 and 3306, Chapter 33, Volume 5, of the DOD FMR. CHs must successfully complete the required GPC and ethics training to be delegated micro-purchase authority prior to receiving a GPC (see paragraph 2-2). The SCO or COC may delegate in writing to the Level 3 or 4 A/OPC the authority to delegate micro-purchase authority to CHs. A sample delegation of micro-purchase authority is provided at Appendix F.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The BO is also a Certifying Officer within the context of the GPC program. The Certifying Officer s minimum qualifications and eligibility are further discussed in DOD FMR Volume 5, Chapter 33. BOs are responsible for the accuracy of payments, including designation of the proper appropriation(s) or other funds certified to the paying office and Disbursing Officer. BOs are financially responsible for any illegal, improper, or incorrect payment as a result of an inaccurate or misleading certification. To certify GPC invoices for payment by the DFAS, the BO must be appointed as and accept the responsibilities of a Certifying Officer using the DD Form 577 and complete ethics and fiscal law training (see paragraph 2-2). The BO completes and signs the DD577 and provides to the A/OPC in order for the A/OPC to set up the BO account. The A/OPC provides the original signed and completed DD Form 577 to the supporting DFAS, ATTN: GPC. The BO and A/OPC retain a copy.</p>

            <p>GPCs are issued only as mission requirements dictate. Only DOD civilian employees, military personnel, or members of the Armed Forces may be issued a GPC or be appointed a BO. GPCs may not be issued to contractor personnel, except as provided in Section 1-6. Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) instructors, OCONUS local national employees of the Army, and host Government direct hires for OCONUS agencies/organizations whose salaries are reimbursed by the Army, are not considered DOD contractors, and may be designated as CHs and BOs.</p>

            <p>Each GPC account has a single purchase transaction limit and monthly purchase limit. Generally the single purchase limit is the micro-purchase threshold. The cumulative spending total of all CHs monthly purchases make up the billing cycle limit for the BO. Total monthly purchases may not exceed the billing cycle limit that is established in the Servicing Bank s transaction authorization system. The CH s monthly spending limits are modified by the RM in AXOL when operational circumstances warrant. The Level 4 A/OPC is notified of the monthly spending limits change, approves the change, and forwards the change to the Servicing Bank.</p>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>Use of the GPC by an authorized CH to make an unauthorized purchase is the liability of the Government. However, the installation/organization is responsible for taking appropriate action against the CH including efforts to recover the funds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The intentional use of the GPC for other than official Government business may be considered an attempt to commit fraud against the U.S. Government. Misuse may result in immediate cancellation of an individual's card, financial liability, and negative administrative and/or disciplinary action against the CH and, if warranted, against the BO.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Liability: GPC BOs are personally and pecuniarily liable for the full amount of any improper payments resulting from misuse, abuse, or unauthorized purchases of the GPC, in accordance with Title 31 U.S.C. 3528. Strict pecuniary liability attaches automatically when there is an erroneous (illegal, improper, or incorrect) payment. GPC CHs are pecuniarily liable for erroneous payments that result from the negligent performance of duties in the amount of erroneous payment, up to one month s pay. All accountable officials are required to comply with DOD regulations, policies, and procedures, including standard operating procedures. Failure to act in accordance with such regulations, policies, and procedures is generally considered evidence of negligence. Following orders from superiors that are contrary to regulations, policies, and procedures, is no defense to negligence or bad faith. A heavy workload or a lack of experience, supervision, or training, is not a factor in determining relief from liability.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Statutory authority: Any misuse of the GPC is subject to criminal, civil, Uniform Code of Military Justice, administrative, and disciplinary actions as appropriate.</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>
                    <p>CHs: DOD FMR defines a CH as a DAO, and as such, are liable for up to one month s pay for misuse resulting from their negligent actions. DOD Directive 7000.14-R imposes financial liability for negligent performance of the CH s duties. The FMR Vol. 5, Chapter 33, 3309 also discusses pecuniary liability. Accountable Officials shall be personally and pecuniarily liable for erroneous payments that result from the negligent performance of duties in the amount of the erroneous payment, up to one month s pay.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>BOs: Title 31 U.S.C. 3528 provides for personal and pecuniary liability for improper payments resulting from misuse/abuse of the purchase card for Certifying Officials. The GPC BO meets the definition for Certifying Officer in the DOD FMR. The BO is financially liable for improper payments resulting from misuse or abuse of the GPC. The act of certifying a billing statement for payment makes the BO financially responsible for illegal, improper, or incorrect payment due to an inaccurate or misleading certification. Consequently, a BO who knowingly makes a false certification may be asked to repay the Government for the items or service purchased. If a BO is unsure about certification, he/she should contact the supporting Level 4 A/OPC for guidance and/or assistance.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Investigation Required: When a review/audit of the GPC account indicates questionable purchases, to include unauthorized purchases, the reviewer must ask the Certifying Officer for justification. If there is no justification, the reviewer must notify the BO s Commander or Director. The Commander or Director must conduct an investigation in accordance with AR 15-6. The investigation must provide the DOD employee or military member with an opportunity to rebut the presumed liability. Failure to follow regulation and policy constitutes negligence.</p>

The waiver process is located at <a href="https://chess.army.mil">https://chess.army.mil</a>. Waivers are granted when products are unavailable on CHESS contracts or when hardware and software is available at a lower price from an alternate source. A CHESS waiver does not constitute approval to purchase any product or deviate from any other Army regulation or policy. Individual waivers are approved by CHESS and Army organization/activity blanket waivers are approved by the Army Chief Information Officer (CIO)/G-6.

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>OMB standards for internal controls require that key duties and responsibilities be divided or segregated among individuals to ensure they do not exceed or abuse their assigned authority, OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B Revised, paragraph 4.3. Separation of duties is an internal control activity, intended to provide checks and balances to the GPC process, to prevent or minimize innocent errors or intentional fraud occurring without detection. This is done by ensuring that no single individual has control over multiple phases of a purchase card transaction. To protect the integrity of the procurement process, no one person is responsible for an entire purchase card transaction. Key purchase card functions must be handled by different individuals. Inadequate separation of duties could allow errors and fraud to occur without detection. Key duties, such as making purchases-CH, authorizing payments-BO, certifying funding-RM, and reviewing transactions-Level 4 A/OPCs and PBOs must be assigned to different individuals in order to minimize the risk of loss to the Government to the greatest extent possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If resource constraints prevent assignment of the key duties to different individuals, as set forth in paragraph (a) above, the activity must request a waiver through the Level 4 A/OPC and the CCO to the Level 3 A/OPC for approval, and will require additional surveillance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Notwithstanding the above-described waiver process, certain key duties must not be assigned to the same individual. In no case shall the same individual be the CH and the BO for a GPC account. In no case shall the CCO, Property Book Officer, or any Level 4 A/OPC (primary or alternate) also be a CH, BO or contracting officer who is making contract payments with a GPC or executing GPC purchases. A CH, who is a hand receipt holder, should not purchase property for their own use. PCOLS provides the functionality to generate a report identifying potential conflicts of interest in GPC Program duties.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="span-of-control">3-7. Span of Control</h2>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>The Army standard for span of control for a Level 4 A/OPC is 300 accounts. This number includes both BO and CH accounts. A ratio of not more than seven card accounts to an A/BO is the Army standard. Ensuring a reasonable number of card accounts are assigned to each A/BO or Certifying Officer account is paramount to the effective accomplishment of the A/BO or Certifying Officer s responsibilities. The total number of transactions, as well as the number of assigned card accounts, must be considered when determining an acceptable account-to-A/BO ratio. Span of control refers to the extent of oversight and review responsibilities placed on a single A/OPC or BO. An appropriate span of control must efficiently and effectively allow the A/OPC or BO to provide reasonable assurance they can effectively perform their responsibilities regardless of the number of accounts assigned. The assigned span of control must factor in a Level 4 A/OPC s responsibility to conduct an annual review of all BO accounts including semi-annual surveillance of 25% of all transactions under his/her oversight. A span of control too large may preclude the A/OPC from accomplishing this task effectively and efficiently.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When the number of accounts (300:1 accounts per A/OPC) or workload complexity/administration assigned to a Level 4 A/OPC exceeds the Army standard, the SCO and the CCO must ensure adequate resources are made available to allow the Level 4 A/OPC s successful performance of his or her duties. When the span of control exceeds the Army standard by more than 10 percent and the CCO elects not to provide additional resources, the CCO must provide the SCO with formal documentation stating that the CCO has personally reviewed the existing span of control and has determined the span of control is adequate to ensure program administration and surveillance can be performed at a satisfactory level. The Level 3 A/OPC must retain a copy of this documentation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When the ratio for CH accounts to BOs exceeds the Army standard, the BO shall prepare a request for a waiver to policy. The approval levels for waivers are indicated in paragraph 3-7e. The total number of transactions as well as the number of assigned CH accounts must be considered when determining an acceptable card and/or checking account-to-BO ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Upon the nomination and approval of a prospective CH and during the annual review of BO accounts, the Level 4 A/OPCs determines if the span of control is acceptable?that is, whether the BO can reasonably be expected to complete a thorough review of all transactions and certify the invoice within five business days of its receipt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The Level 4 A/OPC documents all cases where the CH-to-Billing Official ratio exceeds the Army standard. In these cases, the BO prepares a request for a waiver to policy. The request must address the unique conditions that affect the process and show, with a high degree of certainty, that the BO can be expected to comply with the review and certification procedures. The request must include the number and location of assigned CHs, the total average number of transactions made by the CHs, the amount of time the BO can devote to the certification process, the history of delinquencies, and other factors that seem appropriate. The waiver is approved at the following level indicated below and maintained by the approver with copies furnished to the BO:</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>

            <p>Centrally Billed GPC accounts are exempt from state tax in EVERY state but require tax exemption forms in 13 states, including Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. For purchases within the United States, the CH informs the merchant that the purchase is for official U.S. Government purposes and, therefore, is not subject to state or local sales tax. The GPC is embossed with the statement U.S. GOVT TAX EXEMPT and the CH will point this statement out to any merchant attempting to apply taxes to a purchase. In those states where a tax exemption form is required, the CH obtains the required form from the GSA SmartPay Website at:</p>

By clicking on the state in the map, there is a link to download the required forms, as well as contact information for the Department of Revenue should additional questions arise. CHs are responsible for ensuring no sales tax has been included in their purchase, except where applicable.</p>

            <p>Exceptions to the state tax rules above include Hawaii and Illinois. Both states levy a General Excise Tax (GET) on businesses selling tangible personal property which is allowed to be passed on to the Federal Government (customer).</p>

    <h2 id="surcharges">3-9. Surcharges</h2>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>Surcharges are fees that a retailer adds to the cost of a purchase when a customer uses a charge/credit card. As a result of the settlement between a class of retailers and the brands, on January 27, 2013, merchants in the United States and U.S. Territories are permitted to impose a surcharge on cardholders when a charge/credit card is used.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Not all merchants impose a surcharge, and some states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma and Texas) have laws which do not allow or limit surcharges. Cardholders who receive a surcharge or a check out fee in any of the above mentioned states should report the merchant to the state Attorney General s Office.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Surcharges may not be added to debit, prepaid or cash purchases and cardholders are required to be notified in advance of making the purchase if a merchant will impose a surcharge. Merchants must also include the surcharge fee on any receipt(s) provided to the cardholder.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Per Visa and MasterCard guidance, there is a limit to the allowable surcharge amounts. These limits vary by brand and by merchant discount rate. Information on surcharge limitations for Visa and MasterCard is available at:</p>

If the statement is correct, the CH approves it within three business days from the end of the billing cycle. If the statement is incorrect, the CH must contact the merchant and request correction. If the merchant does not cooperate or provide the ordered goods and services, the CH disputes the incorrect transaction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The BO must ensure GPC transactions are legal, proper, and correct in accordance with Government rules and regulations. If the billing statement is correct following the BO s review throughout the month, certification of the billing statement is done within five business days from the end of the billing cycle. If the BO finds questionable transactions, the CH must be contacted to review supporting documentation. If the BO determines the CH is negligent, the BO takes appropriate action in accordance with DOD and Army policy, and informs the Level 4 A/OPC of the action taken. Disputes must be filed by one of three methods: calling the Servicing Bank, faxing over a Cardholder Statement of Questioned Items form or using the Servicing Bank s dispute process in AXOL, within 60 days of the cycle end date in which the transaction appeared in order to retain the Government s dispute rights.</p>

            <p>All financial records, both paper and electronic, must be retained documenting the GPC transactions in a file to include (1) the BO statement, (2) the CH statement, and (3) all original receipts and documentation for those statements.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Receipts are considered supporting documents for the certified billing statement and in accordance with the DOD FMR, Volume 1, Chapter 9, must be retained for six years and three months after final payment. Original receipts are preferred; however, printed electronic forms or copies of an itemized receipt are acceptable. The receipt must be legible; goods must be itemized/detailed with the item description, quantity, price, and extended price; indicate vendor s name and address; date of the purchase; and must indicate paid by credit card or zero amount due. The BO maintains these records, either physically in his/her physical possession, or when appropriate transfers to a records holding area. However, if certifying electronically, the CH and BO may rely on the Servicing Bank recordkeeping for the BO and CH statements.

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>Convenience checks and Foreign Draft Checks (FDCs) provide activities with the flexibility to issue checks for payment of supplies and services. With the exception of contingencies, convenience checks shall not be written over the micro-purchase threshold. Convenience checks are issued for domestic purchases valued in U.S. dollars when the merchant does not accept the GPC. DOD activities have the flexibility to issue convenience checks to pay for products and services at the activity level. FDCs are issued for overseas purchases valued in foreign currency when the merchant does not accept the GPC. The following requirements apply to one or both of these financial instruments as specified.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The CH shall not use a convenience check or FDC unless its use is considered advantageous to the activity after evaluating all alternative methods of purchase. Convenience checks and FDCs may not be used to avoid the normal GPC payment process. Before a check is issued, the paying agency must make every effort to use the GPC, including making maximum efforts to find and use merchants that accept the GPC. The authority to maintain a checkbook shall be justified on an individual organization basis and controlled and monitored by the organization s CCO. The number of checkbooks per installation must be kept to a minimum. A delegation of procurement authority is granted in writing by the CCO for the maintenance and use of convenience checks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Convenience checkbook accounts are available only to organizations that maintain active GPC accounts in good standing. A convenience checkbook holder may have a GPC account and a separate convenience checkbook account. Convenience checks are pre-numbered, and their use is controlled with a separate convenience check purchase log for each account. Checkbook holder shall maintain original voided checks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Convenience checks and FDCs are not issued for more than the micro-purchase threshold (or the foreign currency equivalent), and must be issued for the exact payment amount. In the case of an FDC, the payment amount includes the administrative processing fee. However, in the case of convenience checks, the payment amount does not include the administrative processing fee. The convenience check processing fee is added by the servicing bank during processing of the transaction, and the addition of the processing fee is not considered a split requirement. Splitting payment amounts across more than one convenience check or FDC to keep the purchase amount per check below the micro-purchase threshold limit is prohibited. Convenience checks and FDCs will not be issued as an exchange-for-cash vehicle to establish cash funds. If merchants issue credit or refunds by cash or check, the funds must be immediately credited to the account against which the purchase was originally made.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Convenience checks and FDCs are negotiable instruments and must be stored in a locked container, such as a safe or locking filing cabinet. Checks must be accounted for appropriately to prevent loss, theft, or potential forgery. Convenience check and FDC accounts must be reviewed quarterly by a disinterested party and not the A/OPC. The checks are reconciled just as other GPC transactions, as a part of the monthly statement billing cycle. Copies of voided checks must be retained through the carbon copy or photocopy the original check as a part of the account-holder's original documentation files.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The same purchase prohibitions that apply to the GPC apply to the convenience check and the FDC.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The normal dispute process associated with the GPC is not applicable to convenience checks and FDCs. Any concerns over a purchase made with a check must be resolved directly with the merchant. The check writer is solely responsible for securing credit or disputing purchases with the merchant. Each organization is responsible for all checks written on an account; unless it is determined fraud is involved (see Section 4-5 on fraud). In some cases, payment can be stopped on a convenience check that has been written if the check has not yet been posted to an account. To stop payment on a check, the check-writer must call the Servicing Bank s Customer Service Department to receive instructions on processing the action.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>FDC accounts are established in the contracting office. Customer activities desiring FDC accounts outside the contracting office must justify, in writing, to the CCO why an account is necessary. FDC BOs, cashiers, and custodians must receive standard GPC training prior to being issued active FDC accounts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The check cashier is the only person who has the authority to issue and sign checks. He or she may hold a GPC account in addition to the convenience check FDC account, as long as the accounts are maintained separately.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The check custodian orders, receives, stores, issues, inventories, reconciles, and disposes of FDC stock. He or she is not responsible for approving and processing requirements for check writing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The BO authorizes and certifies the issuance of FDCs written by the cashier. In order to maintain effective internal controls, the BO may not perform the check-writing and maintenance functions of the cashier and custodian. All convenience checks and FDCs must be reconciled as a part of the monthly billing statement at the end of the billing cycle.</p>
        </li>

    <h2 id="office-supply-blanket-purchase-agreements-bpas">3-15. Office Supply Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)</h2>
    <p>The Army must satisfy requirements for supplies and services from or through the sources and publications listed in the descending order of priority in FAR Part 8.002. The Office Supply BPAs fall under mandatory Federal supply schedules and must be utilized for office supply purchases unless an exception applies. The Office Supply BPAs can be accessed through the Army Corridor of the DOD EMALL site: <a href="https://dod-emall.dla.mil/acct/">https://dod-emall.dla.mil/acct/</a>. The primary goals of the Office Supply BPAs are to ensure that office product purchases are in compliance with the statutory preferences afforded to products manufactured under the AbilityOne Program, capture economies of scale, and realize significant savings while providing opportunities for small business. Exceptions to the mandatory use of the BPAs and DOD EMALL are as follows:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <p>This policy does not apply to purchases made Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Purchases made directly from AbilityOne or from AbilityOne Base Supply Centers (BSCs). Cardholders may purchase office and cleaning supplies directly from AbilityOne Base Supply Centers and are exempt from using the Office Supply BPAs. These products are available at Base Supply Centers on military installations or in federal buildings.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cardholders may purchase National Stock Number (NSN) items directly from AbilityOne BSCs and are exempt from using the Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) or the Office Supply BPAs. When NSN products are not available from the BSCs, then cardholders should use the SARSS to purchase NSN Products.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Purchases made from wholesale supply sources such as stock programs of the General Services Administration (e.g. GSA Global Supply Center).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cardholders may purchase an item from another source if an urgent need exists for an unplanned requirement needed for the same day. Poor acquisition planning and inadequate market research would not apply to this exception. Use of this exception requires valid documentation and retention in the purchase card file.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>NAFI cardholders must comply with the required sources (see paragraph 3-5). When purchasing office supplies, NAFI GPC cardholders shall consider the AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or the Office Supply BPAs on the DOD EMALL Army Corridor as a practical choice. If it is not in the best interest of the NAFI to purchase through AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or the Office Supply BPAs, the cardholder may consider other required sources. The cardholder must adequately document the decision to not purchase from the AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or the Office Supply BPAs before an open-market source can be considered.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In the event the DoD EMALL is unavailable for more than 24 hours, cardholders may place orders with the Office Supply BPA vendor through another form of communication.</p>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>Rebates are posted as credits against billing statements and applied at the billing statement level unless specified otherwise by the Level 2 A/OPC. Rebates are automatically assigned to the default line of accounting (LOA) on the billing statement. BOs should reallocate the rebates across various LOAs (of the same appropriation) to the extent that no single LOA has a credit balance. Under no circumstance will the CH retain gift checks, vendor rebates or other purchase incentives that can be converted to personal use. If received, these items must be turned over to the U.S. Treasury.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Unless specific authority exists allowing rebates to be used for other purposes, rebates must be returned to the appropriation or account from which they were expended, and can be used for any legitimate purchase by the appropriation or account to which they were returned, or as otherwise authorized by statute.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Credit transactions are posted as credits against billing statements, applied at the billing statement level. When a closed account carries a credit balance the amount shall be sent via check to the Level 4 A/OPC. The check will be addressed to US Government or US Treasury. The Level 4 A/OPC shall work with his/her RM in identifying an account and in determining how the credit is distributed within the installation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Reimbursements such as rebates, merchant credits, or other credits attributable to accounts closed during the quarter or accounts not having enough purchases to offset the credit, require the Servicing Bank to issue quarterly checks to the Level 4 A/OPC. Merchant credits must be applied back to the funding appropriation. Rebates must be used in the fiscal year they are received.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Each Level 4 A/OPC is directed to deliver all reimbursement check(s) to their RM within five (5) days of receipt, retain a copy of each reimbursement check(s), and obtain the RM's signature acknowledging their receipt and acceptance of the reimbursement check(s). The CH, BO, and RM should have a process to ensure adequate controls are in place to track credits and rebates. Questions related to reimbursements in the form of a rebate, merchant credit, or other credit should be directed to your local RM. CHs must forward their monthly cardholder statement to the BO with the appropriate supporting documentation, within 5 working days, to maximize rebates and minimize prompt payment penalties.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>PCOLS is a DoD-wide suite of electronic systems that GPC officials use to improve the management and accountability within their GPC program organizations. PCOLS is comprised of five applications: Enterprise Monitoring and Management of Accounts (EMMA), Authorization, Issuance, and Maintenance (AIM), PCOLS Reporting, Data Mining (DM), and Risk Assessment (RA). PCOLS is Common Access Card (CAC) enabled to ensure secure authentication and nonrepudiation. Due to enhancement of program oversight, the Purchase Card On-Line System (PCOLS) is mandated for GPC participants Army-wide and accessible at: <a href="https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/pcols-web/"><strong>https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/pcols-web</strong>/</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span class="underline">EMMA</span> is used to capture and define organizational purchase card hierarchies, document authority chains, and identify relationships among purchase card roles. EMMA increases the accuracy of personnel data and institute more robust inclusion of supervisors (e.g., cardholder and managing account supervisors). EMMA acts to electronically define the GPC hierarchy, the roles within the hierarchy, and assigns individuals to those roles. Additionally, EMMA enables the A/OPC to alter or remove any personnel from assigned roles reflecting changes to hierarchy structures, also known as provisioning.</p>

        <li>
            <p><span class="underline">AIM</span> is used to initiate, approve, and transmit requests for GPC issuance and maintenance actions. AIM draws from hierarchies (e.g., role responsibilities and permissions) established in EMMA. It directly engages GPC supervisors, helps ensure business rules comply with internal organizational management controls, and is a workflow tool performing various GPC Program account authorization and maintenance functions.</p>

            <p><span class="underline">Data Mining (DM)</span> programmatically reviews 100% of the DoD purchase card transactions using sophisticated intelligent/learning software and identifies correlations, patterns, and trends in purchase card buying actions. This transaction review allows daily, near-real-time mining of the data. The Case Manager, which is an integral component of DM, interprets the referred transactions and creates specific cases that are assigned to the Approving/Billing Officials (A/BOs) for review. Through the use of the Case Manager Interview Process, the A/BO demonstrates that due diligence is exercised in the review of the referred transactions. With this DM tool, scarce human resources can be targeted on identified high-risk transactions and maintain a record of actions taken on referred transaction reviews for improved internal audit ability of the program.</p>

            <p><span class="underline">Risk Assessment (RA)</span>, together with results from the DM Application, assess and report on the overall "health" of a DoD organization's purchase card program. RA allows users to monitor risks associated with their purchase card program. Users assess the risk of their purchase card program by monitoring certain risk controls on a cycle-by-cycle basis. This monitoring is accomplished through the following components within the RA Application: controls, dashboards, and quarterly reports.</p>

    <p>If, as a result of findings from a surveillance visit, or by any other means, the A/OPC discovers a CH or BO has violated GPC procedures, the A/OPC shall document the violation and take action to resolve the noncompliance to include, if necessary, retraining of the CH or BO and/or temporarily suspending the CH or BO s GPC privileges. Any determinations to cancel or permanently suspend a CH or BO account shall be made by the Level 2 A/OPC, CCO or designee (e.g. Level 3 or 4 A/OPC), and their findings forwarded to the CH or BO s supervisor. Continual violation of GPC procedures by an individual CH or BO shall result in termination of GPC privileges. A/OPCs shall verify that all potentially fraudulent and erroneous transactions that have been identified are disputed and properly resolved. Evidence of deliberate abuse shall be referred to the CH s and/or BO s Commander by the CCO for appropriate action in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice or civilian disciplinary rules. Evidence of fraud or other criminal activity shall be referred, by the Commander/CCO, to the appropriate investigative body (e.g. Office of the Inspector General (OIG), Army Audit Agency (AAA)) or other investigative body for a follow up investigation.

    <p>The AbilityOne Program strives to ensure that its products are priced within the fair market range. Obtaining a commercial product at a lower price than an AbilityOne product is not a valid reason to circumvent the AbilityOne Program mandate. If you feel the AbilityOne product is priced significantly higher than a commercial item, you should contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance. AbilityOne does not offer a general-use, white, 8.5 x 11 or 30% recycled copy paper. AbilityOne s copy paper is for letterhead application and is archival quality. Since AbilityOne is not a mandatory source for a general-use paper (30% recycled is considered general use), you don t need a waiver from AbilityOne for the purchase of general-use copy paper and may purchase from AbilityOne Base Supply Centers or another source such as the office supply BPAs on the DOD EMALL Army Corridor.</p>

The gaining activity in the contingency operation area determines if a soldier requires a GPC. If it is determined that the mobilized reservist requires a GPC, the unit s command identifies the FORSCOM home station responsible for its issuance. All GPC accounts (CH and BO) for mobilized reservists are managed by the FORSCOM home station installation A/OPC to which the contingency unit is assigned.

            <p>A merchant that has been blocked may still sell items that are authorized for purchase with the GPC. If a CH determines that he or she must make a purchase from a source that has been blocked because of its assigned MCC, the following procedures apply. The request to override a merchant s blocked MCC must be prepared by the BO of the CH who wants to make the purchase. The request must contain the name and masked account number (show only the last 10 digits of the account number) of the CH, a description of the item(s) to be purchased, the merchant s exact name and address, the MCC that must be overridden, the estimated dollar amount of the purchase, the estimated date of the purchase, and a description of efforts to locate a source other than the merchant with the blocked MCC. In addition, the request must specify the need for the particular requirement (for example, a special magnifying glass, available only from a jewelry store, needed to examine circuit card wiring). The request is routed through the appropriate Level 4 A/OPC to the Level 3 A/OPC for approval. Approvals are granted on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This process does not allow recurring purchases from a restricted merchant. If the request is approved, the Level 4 A/OPC contacts the Servicing Bank to have the specific transaction approved from the restricted merchant. The CH has five days to make the purchase. At the time of purchase, the CH advises the merchant to call the Servicing Bank s Customer Service Department and provide the following information:</p>

        Appendix D: Department of Defense (DoD) Purchase Card Checklist and Certification Template</h1>
    <p><strong>Function:</strong> The function covered by this checklist is the administration of the Government Purchase Card Program.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The Army GPC Operating Procedures mandates a review of each Billing Official account annually, to include a representative sample of associated card transactions. The purpose of these reviews is to ensure compliance with GPC program policy/guidance and other applicable government regulations, policies, and procedures; and to identify any GPC misuse, fraud, waste, and abuse. The attached checklist below is designed to help reviewers perform the required review. Each activity is encouraged to supplement and tailor their review checklist to include any unique requirements. It may be necessary to complete one check list for each CH associated with the BO account. Place a copy in each CH s file.</p>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Answers must be based on the actual testing of key internal controls (e.g., document analysis, direct observation, sampling, simulation, and other). Answers that indicate deficiencies must be explained and corrective action indicated in supporting documentation.</p>

A receipt is a legal document which serves as a permanent record of the transaction that can be used to support financial records (i.e. billing official invoice). Internet shopping has led to the creation of <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-electronic-cash.htm">electronic</a> receipts. Many online businesses provide the cardholder with the option of printing a receipt of the transaction as soon as the payment is approved. In addition, the vendor may provide the cardholder with an <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-email.htm">email</a> copy of the receipt. The receipt includes basic information about the nature of the sale. This essential detail includes the date of the transaction, a list of the prices of the items purchased, subtotal, applicable taxes, and a final total. Some receipts will provide unit prices and extended prices when multiple units of the same item are purchased, as well as a detailed description of each item.</p>
    <p><strong>Required or Mandatory Sources of Supply</strong> - The priority of sources is dictated by FAR Part 8, Required Sources of Supplies and Services, Subpart 8.001, Priorities for Use of Government Supply Sources, and DFARS 208. Mandatory sources must be considered before an open-market source can be considered. Other mandatory sources include DLA Printing Services, Army CHESS, Army BPAs.</p>
    <p><strong>Resource Manager (RM)</strong> - RM is a Certifying Officer who certifies that funds are available for the GPC program and establishes lines of accounting used on the GPC</p>
    <p>Appendix J: Glossary (continued)</p>
    <p>program. The RM is responsible for the proper assignment of funding on an obligation document before the obligation is incurred, and for maintaining a system of positive funds control.</p>
    <p><strong>Split Purchase</strong> - Occurs when a CH splits a known requirement at the time of the purchase into several transactions in order to: circumvent dollar thresholds in order to use the GPC; to avoid competitive bids for purchases over the micro-purchase threshold; or to avoid other established credit limits (this is prohibited). When a known small purchase requirement exceeds the micro-purchase threshold, it must be purchased through a contract using simplified acquisition procedures. Examples of Split Purchases or Split Requirements include the following:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <p>A single CH making multiple purchases from the same merchant on the same day, the total of which exceeds the single purchase limit and the total requirement was known at the time of the first purchase.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2" type="1">
        <li>
            <p>A single CH purchasing the same/similar item(s) from multiple merchants on the same day, the total of which exceeds the single purchase limit and the total was known at the time of the first purchase.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>A single CH making multiple purchases of similar items from the same or multiple merchants over a period of time when the total requirement was known at time of the first purchase and the value exceeds the single purchase limit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Multiple CHs under the same supervision/billing official purchasing the same/similar item(s) the same day or in a compressed timeframe when the total requirement is known at a given time and exceeds the single purchase limit.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Third Party Payments</strong> - An online payment processor (i.e. PayPal, 2Checkout.com) provides ways for a merchant to accept credit cards and other payments online without the extra cost and obligation of a merchant account. Where it is identified that a purchase will be processed via a third party merchant (i.e. PayPal), the CH should make every attempt to choose another merchant with whom to procure the goods and/or services. If still found necessary to procure using a third party payment merchant, the CH and BO must ensure there is adequate supporting documentation to prove that there was a detailed review of the purchase and that the use of the third party payment merchant was unavoidable. Transactions made with a third party payment merchant are considered high risk for both subsequent audit and data mining screening.</p>
    <p><strong>Training - Commercial Off-the-Shelf Training</strong> - is defined as training products and services regularly available to the general public and/or Government personnel. The term includes training offered in catalogs or other printed material by a college, university, professional association, consultant firm or organization.
