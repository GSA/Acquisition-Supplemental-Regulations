If contracting personnel will conduct the independent review, the HCA will appoint a review authority. See Appendix GG for further delegation. The HCA or delegated designee, may also appoint individuals assigned outside contracting channels as a review authority (e.g., attorneys, chief of staff, installation commanders).</p>
<h4 id="annual-agency-bid-protest-report.">5133.103-90 Annual agency bid protest report.</h4>

If the GAO decides to use the express option and the contracting officer concludes that the report cannot be furnished in time, he/she must notify the appropriate office in (<em>i</em>)-(<em>iii</em>) at once so that it may request an extension from GAO.</p>
<p>(<em>2</em>) Before forwarding the report to the GAO Comptroller General, the addressees in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(<em>1</em>)(<em>i</em>)-(<em>iii</em>) of this section must review the report and recommend any changes required to ensure that the report is accurate, complete, and legally sufficient.</p>

<p>(<em>2</em>) Whether reasonable alternatives to the override exist that would adequately address the circumstances presented;</p>
<p>(<em>3</em>) How the potential costs of proceeding with the override, including the costs associated with the potential that GAO might sustain the protest, compare to the benefits associated with the approach being considered for addressing the agency s needs; and</p>

Process the request for approval as required in paragraph (b).</p>
<p>(g) <em>Notice to GAO</em>. The head of the contracting activity shall report to GAO as described at FAR 33.104(g). See Appendix GG for further delegation. Send the report to the addressee in 5101.290(b)(1) not later than 45 days after receipt of the recommendations.</p>

<h3 id="subpart-5133.2-disputes-and-appeals">Subpart 5133.2 - Disputes and Appeals</h3>
<h4 id="applicability.">5133.203 Applicability.</h4>
<p>(b)(2) The Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) shall determine the application at FAR 33.203. See Appendix GG for further delegation.</p>
<h4 id="policy.">5133.204 Policy.</h4>
<p>(a) As used in this section:</p>
<p> Dispute Resolution Specialist  means the official designated by the head of an agency to implement agency ADR policy as prescribed by Section 3(b) of the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996, 5 U.S.C. 571-584 and Note. The Principal Deputy General Counsel of the Army is designated the Army Dispute Resolution Specialist.</p>
<p> Issue in controversy  means a material disagreement between the Army and a contractor that may result in a claim, or is all or part of an existing claim.</p>
<p>(b) Contracting officers and their legal counsel, assisted by other members of the Acquisition Team as necessary, are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to resolve pre-appeal disputes (e.g., claims, unresolved requests for equitable adjustment, and other issues in controversy) to the maximum extent practicable and appropriate. For any dispute in which unassisted negotiations have reached impasse or in which the contracting officer has received a request for ADR, the contracting officer shall review the dispute to determine whether ADR is appropriate for resolving it, applying the reasons listed in paragraph (c) of this section. If the contracting officer finds ADR to be appropriate, the contracting officer should offer or agree to ADR. Participation in ADR does not obligate any party to settle or accept a proposal for settlement. This section does not create any right to ADR for any contractor or prospective contractor, and a decision by the contracting officer finding ADR to be inappropriate is not subject to appeal.</p>
<p>(c) The use of ADR to resolve an issue in controversy is generally authorized if the parties agree. However, the contracting officer or other authorized official may decide that ADR is inappropriate to resolve the issue for any of the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) A definitive or authoritative resolution of the matter is required for precedential value, and an ADR proceeding is not likely to be accepted generally as an authoritative precedent.</p>
<p>(2) The matter involves or may bear upon significant questions of Government policy that require additional procedures before a final resolution may be made, and an ADR proceeding would not likely serve to develop a recommended policy for the Army.</p>
<p>(3) Maintaining established policies is of special importance, so that variations among individual decisions are not increased, and an ADR proceeding would not likely reach consistent results among individual decisions.</p>
<p>(4) The matter significantly affects persons or organizations who are not parties to the ADR proceeding.</p>
<p>(5) A full public record of the proceeding is important, and an ADR proceeding cannot provide such a record.</p>
<p>(6) The Army must maintain continuing jurisdiction over the matter with authority to alter the disposition of the matter in the light of changed circumstances, and a dispute resolution proceeding would interfere with the Army s fulfillment of that requirement.</p>
<p>(7) The issue is amenable to a disposition that will fully resolve the matter quickly and with a high probability of finality, including procedures under Rules 11 and 12 of the Rules of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA).</p>
<p>(8) The anticipated transaction costs of ADR in money and time materially exceed the anticipated transaction costs of litigation.</p>
<p>(9) The dispute involves one or more credible allegations or indications of fraud, gross mismanagement, abuse of official authority, or violation of federal or state criminal laws.</p>
<p>(10) Any other specific reason why the contracting officer determines ADR is inappropriate. Sole reliance on this provision to find ADR inappropriate must be approved by the cognizant senior contracting official (SCO), or higher authority. Forward a copy of any decision based on this provision, with supporting rationale, to the Army Dispute Resolution Specialist at <a href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ogc.mbx.adr@mail.mil">usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ogc.mbx.adr@mail.mil</a>. Include the name, telephone number and email address of the point of contact for the decision.</p>
<p>(d) The contracting officer, legal advisor, attorney of record, or other official responsible for procurement ADR matters within the cognizant interested organization(s) may contact the Army ADR Program Office in the Office of the Army General Counsel (SAGC-ADR) for advice and guidance on ADR processes, strategies, and other informal dispute resolution matters. Send correspondence to:</p>
<p>Department of the Army General Counsel</p>

<p>Washington DC 20310-0104;</p>

<p>for dispute resolution guidance.</p>
<p>(e) Appeals filed with the ASBCA are eligible for ADR consideration, consistent with the Chief Trial Attorney s authority over litigation of all ASBCA matters. Apply the reasons in paragraph (c) of this section when considering whether to participate in ADR. All decisions whether to participate in ADR for any issue in controversy are within the Chief Trial Attorney s discretion, and are not subject to appeal.</p>

<p>(a) See 5133.212-90(a)(1) regarding the authority and responsibility of the Chief Trial Attorney.</p>
<p>(b) The Chief Trial Attorney will present all Army cases to the ASBCA, using trial attorneys assigned to the office, except the Chief Trial Attorney may authorize local contract attorneys to act as trial attorneys or to assist in the presentation of Army cases if the appeal has particular significance to the contracting activity and that it involves difficult operational issues and technical facts.</p>
<p>(c) Local legal counsel and personnel within the contracting activity assist and support the Office of the Chief Trial Attorney in preparing the case.</p>
<p>(d) The Chief Trial Attorney and the attorneys assigned may communicate directly with any person or organization to secure any witnesses, documents, or information considered necessary in connection with representing the Government in matters before the ASBCA. The Chief Trial Attorney must inform the contracting officer of any actions taken in connection with these matters.</p>
<h4 id="disposition.">5133.212-96 Disposition.</h4>
<p>(a) The authority and responsibility to settle contract disputes docketed with the ASBCA remains with the contracting officer, subject to (b) and the following:</p>
<p>(1) The contracting officer must advise the Chief Trial Attorney of all offers of settlement from a contractor, whether directly from the contractor or through the contractor s attorney.</p>
<p>(2) The contracting officer must consult with the Chief Trial Attorney before accepting a contractor s offer of settlement and before making a settlement offer to the contractor.</p>
<p>(b) The Chief Trial Attorney has all necessary authority to conclude settlement agreements with the concurrence of the contracting officer, the reviewing official, or the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement). He/she must notify the appropriate Army Command legal office/staff judge advocate of any disagreement regarding the settlement of a case before raising the matter to the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology).</p>
<p>(1) The Chief Trial Attorney or an individual trial attorney may enter into an agreement on matters for which there is no substantial controversy and which will not have the effect of disposing of an appeal, provided that, in the case of a pre-hearing written stipulation or agreement, the Chief Trial Attorney has granted this authority to the individual trial attorney in advance.</p>
<p>(2) In appropriate cases, such as those where time-consuming delays would occur by returning the appeal to the contracting officer, the Chief Trial Attorney or an individual trial attorney acting with the prior approval of the Chief Trial Attorney may enter into an agreement with an appellant which will have the effect of disposing of an appeal after obtaining concurrence from a representative of the HCA. Such agreement may then become the basis of an ASBCA decision disposing of the appeal.</p>
<h4 id="review-of-asbca-decisions.">5133.212-97 Review of ASBCA decisions.</h4>
<p>(a) <em>Contracting activity review.</em></p>
<p>(1) The contracting activity must review ASBCA decisions and, if the HCA thinks that the ASBCA should reconsider a decision or appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the HCA may within 10 calendar days after receipt of the decision, request the Chief Trial Attorney to either -</p>
<p>(i) File a motion for reconsideration, stating the grounds relied upon to sustain the motion; or</p>
<p>(ii) Initiate action seeking an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, stating the basis for such an appeal pursuant to the review standards of section 7107(b) of the Disputes statute (41 U.S.C. chapter 71).</p>
<p>(2) If the Chief Trial Attorney does not concur with a request of the HCA within five calendar days, the Chief Trial Attorney shall forward the request, together with reasons for opposition, through the Judge Advocate General to the addressee in 5101.290(b)(1) for the decision in coordination with the General Counsel of the Army. If the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) determines that the Government will not make a motion for reconsideration or that the Government will not take an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the Chief Trial Attorney may certify this fact to the ASBCA.</p>
<p>(3) When it appears that an adverse decision of the ASBCA has resulted from flaws in the regulations that implement DoD policy rather than an error by the ASBCA, recommendations for changes to acquisition regulations should be developed following the format in DFARS 201.201-1(d)(i) and submitted to the addressee in 5101.290(b)(2)(ii)(B).</p>
<p>(b) <em>Chief Trial Attorney review.</em> The Chief Trial Attorney independently reviews all ASBCA decisions involving Army contracts to determine whether the ASBCA should reconsider any decision or if the Army should appeal a decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>
<h4 id="dispute-settlement-and-judgments-use-of-the-judgment-fund.">5133.212-98 Dispute settlement and judgments, use of the Judgment Fund.</h4>
<p>(a) <em>Judgment Fund.</em></p>
<p>(1) The Disputes statute provides for the use of the Judgment Fund ( the Fund ) (31 U.S.C. 1304) to pay for adverse judgments against the Government. Under certain circumstances, the Army can convert settlement agreements in Disputes statute cases before the ASBCA into consent judgments to access the Judgment Fund to pay for settlements. In Disputes statute cases before federal courts where Department of Justice represents the Army, the Department of Justice may use its independent authority to use the Judgment Fund for settlements. Contracting officers should consult with their legal counsel and their local resource management office prior to taking any actions related to the use of the Judgment Fund. Only authorized officials of a federal agency may submit a request for payment from the Judgment Fund. Requests submitted by anyone other than an authorized federal official are deemed fraudulent. Filing a false or fraudulent claim constitutes a Federal offense that is punishable by fines, imprisonment, or both. (See 31 U.S.C. 3729 and 18 U.S.C. 287.) The authorized official for Army is the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller). Army contracting activities shall follow the policy set forth in this section of the AFARS.</p>
<p>(2) The Army must reimburse the Judgment Fund with funds current as of the date of the judgment. According to the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation, (DoD FMR), Volume 3, Chapter. 8, paragraph 080304F.5, approval authority is required from the cognizant Assistant Secretary of the Military Department (Financial Management and Comptroller) or Defense Agency Comptroller for all Judgment Fund Reimbursements to the Department of the Treasury in excess of $1,000,000.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Fiscal considerations in settlements.</em> If funds appropriate to pay a settlement are expired but the account remains open, contracting officers must use expired funds to pay the settlement. If the account remains open but no expired funds remain, contracting officers must use the Judgment Fund to access current funds to pay the settlement. Access to the Fund requires a consent judgment from the Board or use of the Department of Justice s independent authority to use the Fund. The contracting officer may use current funds to pay the settlement if appropriate accounts are canceled or closed.</p>
<p>(c) <em>Settlement procedures</em>.</p>
<p>(1) The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller) (ASA(FM&C)), tracks available expired funds within the Service.</p>
<p>(2) The Army shall use the following procedures for settlements:</p>
<p>(i) In situations where contract funds have expired but the accounts have not closed, the Army shall fund settlements with expired funds if available. Contracting officers will ascertain the availability of appropriate expired funds through their resource management office.</p>
<p>(ii) If the resource management office determines that no expired funds exist within the Army to fund the settlement and the accounts are not closed, the contracting officer must access the Judgment Fund through a consent judgment in order to use current year funds to pay the settlement (i.e., reimburse the Fund).</p>
<p>(iii) If no expired funds exist but the account remains open, use the following procedure. If current year funds are available to reimburse the Fund, then the contracting officer may enter into a consent decree and allow the Fund to pay the judgment. If there is not sufficient current funding to reimburse the Fund, the contracting officer must receive authorization from the ASA(FM&C) prior to entering into a consent decree.</p>
<p>(iv) If the accounts are closed, use the following procedure. If the contracting officer has sufficient funds to pay the settlement, he/she will not use the Fund, and pay the settlement with Agency funds. If sufficient current funds are not available, ASA(FM&C) will provide approval to access the Fund prior to the contracting officer entering into a consent judgment.</p>
<p>(v) When use of the Judgment Fund is authorized, the contracting officer shall work with the resource management office to ensure execution of the appropriate Certificate of Finality and Financial Management Service forms (FMS Forms 195, 196, 197A and 198 (if appropriate)) and submit the payment request to the FMS. The  reimbursement contact  on FMS Form 196 shall be the ASA(FM&C).</p>
<p>(d) <em>Judgments</em>. Use the following procedures to pay judgments using the Judgment Fund.</p>
<p>(1) The contracting officer shall ascertain the availability of current funds through financial management channels. If current funds are available, the contracting officer will not use the Fund, and will pay the judgment with Agency funds.</p>
<p>(2) If current funds are not available, the contracting officer will pay the judgment using the Fund after proper coordination and authorization from the ASA(FM&C).</p>
<p>(e) <em>Settlement agreements</em>. All settlements converted to consent judgments and funded by the Judgment Fund shall be in writing and contain appropriate release language. The contracting officer, local attorney and trial attorney shall insure that all settlement amounts are fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>(f) <em>Expeditious handling.</em> To expedite handling of settlements, inquiries and approvals that these procedures require may be oral so long as the contracting officer documents them in a memorandum for record.</p>
<h4 id="obligation-to-continue-performance.">5133.213 Obligation to continue performance.</h4>
<p>(a) The HCA must approve the determination to use the alternate paragraph in the clause at FAR 52.233-1. See Appendix GG for further delegation.</p>
<h4 id="contract-clauses.">5133.215 Contract clauses.</h4>

<p>(a) Procedures governing grants and cooperative agreements are set forth in Department of Defense Directive 3210.06, Defense Grant and Agreement Regulatory System (DGARS) and the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) provisions cited in that directive.</p>
<p>(b) 32 CFR section 22.815(e)(1) requires the designation of grant appeal authorities to decide formal administrative appeals brought under 32 CFR section 22.815(e).</p>
<p>(c) The head of the contracting activity (HCA) that awarded the grant or cooperative agreement shall serve as the grant appeal authority, provided that the individual is a general officer or member of the Senior Executive Service. The grant appeal authority may utilize a board in accordance with 32 CFR section 22.815(e)(1). (d) The HCA may not delegate grant appeal authority. In the event that the HCA is not a general officer or member of the Senior Executive Service, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) shall designate a qualified individual as the grant appeal authority on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>(d) The grant appeal authority shall utilize the procedures specified in 32 CFR sections 22.815(e) and (f).</p>
