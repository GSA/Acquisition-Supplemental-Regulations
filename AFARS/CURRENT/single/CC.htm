        <p>(a) PMR reviews by the Office of the DASA(P) (ODASA(P)) to Army Headquarters offices for contracting, Army contracting Commands/Activities, and Offices of the Senior Contracting Official (OSCOs).

    <h4 id="cc-402-approach-of-procurement-management-reviews.">CC-402 Approach of Procurement Management Reviews.</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>(a) PMRs will be collaborative and will emphasize effectiveness of strategic planning, identification and effectiveness of metrics, and the flow of information among organizations at the headquarters and OSCO levels. PMRs will evaluate effectiveness along with compliance with procurement laws, regulations, policies, and best practices at the contract execution level. PMRs will identify improvements needed in contracting policies and procedures.</p>

PMR report findings must be specific and include sufficient information to enable root cause analysis. PMR recommendations must be based on supported findings and be actionable.</p>
