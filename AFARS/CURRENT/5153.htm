<p><strong>This format is mandatory for all justifications and approvals (J&As) in support of other than full and open competition. Contracting officer will tailor the J&A s format to accommodate other type justifications in accordance with the FAR approval thresholds and required content.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Control No:</strong></p>
<p>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and</p>
<p>Open Competition</p>
<p>1. <strong>Contracting Activity:</strong> Specify the contracting activity responsible for this action.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Description of Action:</strong> State whether the approval is for a new contract or a modification. Include the type of contract, type of funds to be used (Military Construction; Research, Development, Test and Evaluation; Other Procurement, Army; or Operation and Maintenance, Army) and, when applicable, the estimated share and ceiling arrangements, and fee or profit.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Description of Supplies/Services:</strong> Name and describe the required supplies/services. Include the estimated total value, including options, if any.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Authority Cited:</strong> Identify the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition followed by the specific FAR citation and its title. For example: 10 United States Code 2304(c)(1) as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Reason for Authority Cited:</strong> Describe how this action requires the use of the authority cited. If applicable, identify the proposed or potential contractor(s) and include a discussion of the proposed contractor s unique qualifications for fulfilling the contract requirements.</p>
<p>(a) The rationale used for justifying the cited authority should be consistent throughout the document as appropriate.</p>
<p>(b) Justifications citing FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) or (iii) as the authority for less than full and open competition on a follow-on contract must reflect (1) substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and/or (2) unacceptable delays in filling agency requirements. If the authority cited is substantial duplication of costs, then paragraph 5 should compare the duplicate costs the government would incur to create competition and the estimated savings expected to be recovered through subsequent competition. In addition, the justification must include an explanation for how the requesting office derived their estimates and why they believe they are a substantial duplication. Justifications citing unacceptable delays must identify firm schedule limitations that do not result from a lack of planning. For example, firm schedule limitations could include an approved Army campaign plan or significant loss of life or property.</p>
<p>(c) Justifications citing FAR 6.302-2 must explain how failure to limit sources would seriously injure the Government, and include a discussion of the required delivery schedule and lead-time involved. If the delay associated with the requirement for first article testing is the principal reason for not awarding the contract on a full and open basis, clearly describe the reasons why first article testing is required and why other quality assurance techniques are inadequate. Contracting officers may submit J&As citing this authority for approval after the contract has been awarded (see FAR 6.302-2(c)(1)).</p>
<p>(d) Justifications citing FAR 6.302-2 or 6 must request offers from as many potential sources as practicable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>(e) If applicable, explain why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition were not developed or are not available.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Efforts to Obtain Competition:</strong> Describe the efforts to solicit offers from as many potential sources as is practicable.</p>
<p>a. <em>Effective competition.</em> Describe the extent of effective competition anticipated for this acquisition. Also, state that the notices required by FAR 5.201 shall be or have been published, and that any bids or proposals received shall be considered.

<p>7. <strong>Actions to Increase Competition:</strong> There may be instances when it is not possible to compete the current acquisition. In these cases, include a statement of the actions taken, or to be taken, to increase competition (e.g., procure needed technical data for full and open competition or breakout subsystems or components for full and open competition) before any subsequent acquisition of the supplies or services. If future competition will be based on the procurement of technical data, provide the approximate date the technical data package will be available.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Market Research:</strong> Describe the extent and the results of the market research (FAR Part 10) conducted to identify all qualified sources. Research must have been meaningful (demonstrated attempt to discover all relevant material) and conducted within the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Interested Sources:</strong> Include a listing of the sources that have written to express interest in the acquisition. If applicable, clearly state  To date, no other sources have written to express an interest.  If 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)/FAR 6.302-1 is the authority cited, explain why other sources were rejected.</p>
<p>10. <strong>Other Facts:</strong> Discuss any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as the following:</p>
<p>a. <em>Procurement history.</em> Reasonable efforts to retrieve the following items from computer records, contract files, competition advocate office files or other sources are expected:</p>
<p>(1) Contract numbers and dates of the last several contracts for these same requirements.</p>
<p>(2) The competitive status of these actions.</p>
<p>(3) Authority previously cited if less than full and open competition was used.</p>
<p>(4) If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, a summary of the contents of paragraph 7 of the justification for that procurement and an explanation of the results.</p>
<p>(5) If any prior contract for this requirement was accomplished using full and open competition, include a detailed explanation of the changed circumstances causing this action to now limit the sources.</p>
<p>(6) An explanation of any unusual patterns that may be revealed by the history, e.g., several consecutive, urgent buys.</p>
<p>(7) If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, briefly describe the circumstances justifying the procurement and whether there have been any significant changes.</p>
<p>b. <em>Other facts</em>. Provide any other facts necessary to justify limiting competition that were not previously stated.</p>
<p>(Certifications will normally be provided on a separate page at the end of the J&A to allow minor, administrative changes to be made during the review process.)</p>

<p>13. <strong>Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:</strong> Include the following determination:</p>
<p>I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Provide the basis for this determination (e.g., describe techniques to be used to determine fair and reasonable price, such as cost analysis, price analysis, audit, should cost, independent Government estimate, etc.).

<p>Government contract (insert contract number) requires (insert contractor s name) to establish and maintain, in accordance with FAR Subpart 45.5 and DFARS Subpart 245.5, a system to control, protect, preserve, and maintain Government property in your possession. The applicable provisions of the referenced contract provide that failure of the contractor to maintain and administer an acceptable program or system shall be presumed to be a failure resulting from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the contractor s managerial personnel.</p>
<p>The Property Administrator, by letter dated (insert date) gave notification that (insert contractor s name) system for the maintenance, protection, preservation, and control of Government property was reviewed and found not to meet the requirements of FAR Subpart 45.5 and DFARS Subpart 245.5 in the following respects:</p>
<p>(list all deficiencies)</p>
<p>By letter of (insert date) you were advised that approval of the property control system would be withdrawn unless the noted deficiencies were corrected by (insert date). As of this date, these corrections have not been accomplished. This undue delay in complying with your contractual requirements concerning Government property and your continued delay in rectifying noted deficiencies indicate a lack of concern by (insert contractor s name) managerial personnel. Therefore, the approval of your Property Control System is withdrawn as of (insert date). As a result of this action, (insert contractor s name) shall be liable for any loss or damage to the Government property occurring after receipt of this notice in accordance with the provisions of the contract.</p>
<p>A copy of this letter is being furnished to the Chief of the Contracting Office. Your failure to maintain an acceptable property control system could adversely affect future recommendations for the award of contracts. Restoration of approval of your property system is dependent upon the correction of the above listed deficiencies to the satisfaction of the contracting officer.</p>
