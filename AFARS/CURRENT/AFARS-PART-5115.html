<p class="List2">(1) The Army Source Selection Supplement (AS3) at <a href="https://spcs3.kc.army.mil/asaalt/procurement/SiteAssets/AFARS/AFARSAA.pdf">Appendix AA</a> contains detailed guidance pertaining to the source selection process. <span style="color:#FF0000 !important"> </span>The AS3 is used in conjunction with this part and supplements the mandatory DoD Source Selection Procedures. It contains information on source selection processes and techniques that the Army uses for competitive, negotiated acquisitions using either formal or informal source selection procedures. See DoD Source Selection Procedures at 1.3, page 2 for exceptions.</p>
<p class="List2">(2) The AS3 is a comprehensive source selection resource which recites best practices that promote source selection flexibility and consistency within a given framework in Army source selections. Army personnel shall use the AS3 resource when conducting competitive source selections. The extent to which personnel will use the processes and techniques described in this supplement will depend upon the complexity and dollar value of each acquisition and the available resources. When using the AS3, apply prudent business sense to tailor the processes to fit the circumstances.</p>

<p class="List1">(c) Early involvement is essential for maximizing industry&rsquo;s contribution to the planning, requirements definition, and acquisition processes. Communications with industry should start prior to drafting any solicitation. Measures will be taken to protect any intellectual property (IP) discussed during the planning/pre-solicitation phase, to include non-disclosure agreements as applicable (<a href="https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN14261_AD2018_26_Final.pdf">see Appendix D of the Implementation Guidance for Army Directive 2018-26</a>)</p>
<p class="List2">(6) When a written acquisition plan is required per DFARS 207.103(d) and a draft request for proposal is not used, contracting officers must include the rationale for not using a draft request for proposal in the plan.</p>
<p class="List1">(f) All non-public contractor-owned IP discussed will be considered proprietary information and will not be disclosed publicly. This includes IP the Government is privy to as a result of discussions, documentation, or demonstrations.</p>

<p class="List4">(B) As stated in the AS3, evaluation factors and subfactors must be definable in readily understood qualitative terms (i.e., adjectival, colors, or other indicators, but not numbers) and represent the key areas of importance for consideration. Numerical weighting (i.e., assigning points or percentages to evaluation factors and subfactors) is not an authorized method of expressing the relative importance of the factors and subfactors.</p>
<p class="List1">(d) When the Government intends to evaluate the cost of future production or performance beyond the instant contract, and to include these costs as part of the basis of selection and award, clearly specify the evaluation procedures for such costs in the solicitation.

<p class="List2">(1) The contracting officers will prepare, review, and obtain approval of prenegotiation memoranda in accordance with the activity&rsquo;s business clearance procedures. In accordance with 5115.406-3, the contracting officer may consolidate the prenegotiation memorandum and price negotiation memorandum (POM/PNM) for competitive or non-competitive acquisitions. When intending to use a consolidated POM/PNM, the contracting officer must still comply with FAR 15.406-1 and DFARS PGI 215.406-1 and obtain written approval of the prenegotiation objectives before negotiation of any pricing action. </p>
<p class="List3">(i) <em>Sole source acquisitions.</em> For sole source actions, the prenegotiation memoranda document compliance with law, regulations, and policy and become the official record demonstrating the exercise of good business judgment. The prenegotiation memoranda describe the contractor&rsquo;s methodology and how it developed its proposal position to the extent it can be determined from the contractor&rsquo;s proposal and fact finding efforts, how the price and technical auditors and reviewers developed their recommendations, and what the negotiator did in developing an independent prenegotiation position considering the pricing, audit, and technical analyses and recommendations. An understanding of the development of each of these positions is important when preparing for negotiations. The Defense Acquisition University&rsquo;s Acquisition Community Connection, available via the Internet at https://acc.dau.mil/pricing, contains the DoD Contract Pricing Reference Guides, which discuss in depth the pricing techniques and factors contracting officers should consider when developing negotiation positions.</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) <em>Competitive negotiated acquisitions.</em> For competitive negotiated acquisitions using formal source selection procedures, the prenegotiation memoranda should include the source selection plan, as well as section M of the solicitation. It should discuss the evaluation criteria and the basis for award contained in the solicitation, set forth a summary schedule of offerors&rsquo; prices and the technical and cost evaluations. It should also include a determination and supporting discussion of offerors determined to be within and outside the competitive range and a summary of the technical and cost evaluation notices the contracting officer intends to discuss with offerors selected to participate in the discussions.</p>
<p class="List2">(2) When a significant disagreement as defined in DFARS PGI 215.406-1(b)(i) exists between the contracting officer and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) auditor, and the auditor requests a higher-level review of the contracting officer&rsquo;s decision, the contracting officer will advise his/her management and provide the name, title and telephone number of the higher-level review authority to the DCAA auditor. The initial higher-level review authority is the chief of the contracting office or district/center contracting chief in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. If the significant disagreement still exists after discussions with the chief of the contracting office, the matter is elevated to the SCO for resolution. If s/he is unable to resolve the disagreement, the HCA will attempt to resolve the disagreement. The HCA will notify the DASA(P) if DCAA elevates the significant disagreement to the Director, DPAP. The contracting officer shall document the disposition of the higher-level review(s) in a memorandum for the contract file.</p>

<p class="List1">(a) Contracting officers must document within the price negotiation memorandum the results of the negotiation in sufficient detail to clearly establish all significant aspects of the contract action. When utilizing a consolidated POM/PNM, the contracting officer must ensure the POM/PNM contains all required content for both documents, in accordance with FAR 15.406 and DFARS PGI 205.406, and is stated in sufficient detail to reconstruct actions and decisions and to support the reasonableness of the final price. </p>
<p class="List1">(b) If the final negotiated price is within a range specifically approved as the prenegotiation objective, and if negotiations did not present information that calls into question the reasonableness of the previously-approved price range, the written approval obtained under 5115.406-1(1) may also serve as the approval for the consolidated POM/PNM. The approved POM/PNM may be used in determining the negotiated price to be fair and reasonable. Notwithstanding this subsection, the contracting officer still must obtain all other required pre-award approvals. </p>
