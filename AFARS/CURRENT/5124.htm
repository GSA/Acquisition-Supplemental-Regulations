The HCAs may further delegate this authority only to the senior contracting official (SCO).</p>

<p> You may appeal, in whole or in part, this denial to the Secretary of the Army (attn: General Counsel). In the event you decide to appeal, your letter of appeal must be postmarked no later than 60 calendar days after the date of this denial letter. Please address your appeal to (<em>HCA address</em>). This denial is made on behalf of the Initial Denial Authority, (<em>name and title</em>), by (<em>name and rank</em>), Head of the Contracting Activity (<em>office</em>).  (<em>Substitute SCO for HCA if the SCO is the HCA s designee.</em>)</p>
<p>(iii) Contracting officers in contracting activities other than the Army Materiel Command and the United States Army Corps of Engineers must send the proposed denial response to the HCA or, if delegated, to the SCO. Include copies of the records recommended for denial with a justification for the denial. Contracting officers in the Army Materiel Command and the United States Army Corps of Engineers must follow the procedures specified by their headquarters.</p>
<p>(iv) After coordination with counsel, the HCA will provide the denial response, modified if necessary, to the requestor.</p>
