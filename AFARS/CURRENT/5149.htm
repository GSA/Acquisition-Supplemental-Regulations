<p>(iv) If both DFARS 249.7001 and 249.7003 apply, the timing requirements of 249.7003 may necessitate release of the 249.7003(b)(2) notification before the 249.7001 notification. In such cases, the contracting officer shall provide the DFARS 249.7003(b)(2) notices within the required timeframe, but shall not provide the contractor with other information on the anticipated termination until the requirements at DFARS 249.7001 and 5149.7001 have been satisfied.</p>
