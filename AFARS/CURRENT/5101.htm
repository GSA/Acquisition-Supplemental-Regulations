<h4 id="purpose.">5101.101 Purpose.</h4>
<p>The Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS) implements and supplements the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) and the DFARS Procedures, Guidance and Information (PGI) to establish uniform policies for Army acquisition. It does not restrict the exercise of good business judgment or stifle innovation.</p>
<h4 id="copies.">5101.105-3 Copies.</h4>
<p>The AFARS is available electronically via the Internet at <a href="https://spcs3.kc.army.mil/asaalt/procurement/AFARS/Home.aspx">https://spcs3.kc.army.mil/asaalt/procurement/AFARS/Home.aspx</a>. The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (ODASA(P)), Procurement Policy Pillar, SAAL-PP will issue notices of AFARS revisions to all senior contracting officials (SCOs).</p>
<h4 id="far-conventions.">5101.108 FAR conventions.</h4>
<p>(b) <em>Delegation of authority.</em> Each authority is delegable within the contracting chain of authority unless otherwise indicated by law, statute, or regulation. All delegations must reference the applicable AFARS citation. Delegations that do not include expiration dates remain effective until a higher authority supersedes or cancels them.</p>
<h4 id="b-s-90-introduction-of-delegations-matrix-at-appendix-gg-and-instructions-for-use.">5101.108(b) (S-90) Introduction of delegations matrix at Appendix GG and instructions for use. </h4>
<p>Delegations of certain procurement authorities are identified throughout the AFARS with a pointer to a matrix, labeled Appendix GG. Appendix GG outlines all delegations of authority within the FAR, DFARS and AFARS, and specifies whether the authority prohibits or allows for further delegation. The Army level of authority identified in the matrix is the lowest level of delegation.</p>
<h4 id="peer-reviews.">5101.170 Peer reviews.</h4>
<p>(a) <em>DoD peer reviews</em>.</p>
<p>(1) The SCO will concur, in writing, on all solicitation and contract packages submitted for each phase of any DoD peer review. For the first phase only, the SCO will send a copy of the written concurrence to the DASA(P) (see 5101.290) and provide a copy to the head of the contracting activity (HCA).</p>
<p>(i) In accordance with <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/policy/policyvault/Class_Deviation_2019-O0010-DPC.pdf">Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC) Class Deviation 2019-O0010, Peer Reviews of Contracts for Supplies and Services</a>, except for procurements of major defense acquisition programs above $1 billion for which the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S)) is the milestone decision authority and USD(A&S) special interest programs, the DASA(P) is responsible for conducting preaward peer reviews for competitive procurements above $1 billion. See Appendix GG for further delegation.</p>
<p>(2) Contracting activities shall provide their rolling annual forecast of acquisitions that will be subject to DoD peer reviews to the address at 5101.290(b)(2)(ii)(A) at the end of each quarter. See 5104.802(f)(4) for peer review forecast requirements.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Component peer reviews.</em></p>
<p>(i) <em>Army peer reviews.</em> With the exception of acquisitions using sealed bidding procedures (see FAR Part 14), a Solicitation Review Board (SRB) and a Contract Review Board (CRB) will approve all procurements with an estimated value of $50 million or more including the award of task and delivery orders. A CRB is required for contract modifications that increase total evaluated price or otherwise increase scope. A CRB is not required for modifications that exercise an option, add incremental funding, or make administrative changes. The SRB and CRB will be independent, multi-functional teams comprised of senior level experts, which will, at a minimum, include representatives from the contracting activity, small business office, office of counsel, requirements community, and in the case of noncompetitive actions, the advocate for competition. The same members should participate in both the SRB and the CRB in order to ensure consistency.</p>
<p>(ii) <em>Objective of Army peer reviews.</em> The SRB/CRB will review and assess the presolicitation, solicitation and contract award documents for consistency, sufficiency, compliance and application of sound business practices. The SRB/CRB will verify that the procurement represents an overall good value to the Government and appropriate obligation of taxpayer funds.</p>
<p>(iii) <em>Resolution of comments.</em> The SCO will establish procedures for resolving all SRB and CRB comments.</p>
<p>(iv) <em>Peer review statistics.</em> Contracting activities will collect peer review statistics, to include annual data on the number of SRB/CRB reviews conducted and waived, identification of any systemic issues or trends, best practices, lessons learned, overall effectiveness of the process, and other data as determined necessary.</p>
<p>(v) <em>Preaward peer reviews for competitive procurements valued at less than $1 billion and noncompetitive procurements valued at less than $500 million.</em></p>
<p>(A) The HCA will chair an SRB and a CRB for:</p>
<p>(<em>1</em>) Competitive procurements valued at $250 million or more but less than $1 billion or</p>
<p>(<em>2</em>) Noncompetitive procurements valued at $250 million or more but less than $500 million. See Appendix GG for further delegation.</p>
<p>(B) The SCO will chair an SRB and a CRB for all procurements valued at $50 million or more but less than $250 million. See Appendix GG for further delegation .</p>
<p>(C) HCAs, SCOs and chiefs of the contracting office may waive the requirement for a formal review board. The contracting officer will include the written waiver in the contract file.</p>
<p>(vi) <em>Postaward peer reviews of contracts for services valued at less than $1 billion.</em></p>
<p>(A) At least once during the period of performance the HCA will conduct a postaward peer review for contracts for services valued at $250 million or more but less than $1 billion. See Appendix GG for further delegation. The information identified in 5137.590-6(a)(8) and 5137.590-7 will serve as the starting point for the postaward reviews. For such reviews, the HCA will provide the Senior Services Manager a postaward peer review summary report. The summary report will address the postaward peer review of service requirements focus areas at DFARS PGI 201.170-3(b) and the postaward peer review required elements at DFARS PGI 201.170-4, and shall be submitted to the email address at 5101.290(b)(2)(ii)(F) no later than 60 days after completion of the review.</p>
<p>(B) The SCO will establish procedures for postaward peer reviews for contracts for services valued at $50 million or more but less than $250 million.</p>
<p>(S-90) If the DASA(P) identifies a procurement as special interest, the ODASA(P) will convene an HQDA review of the procurements. The DASA(P) will serve as the chairperson. Other Army peer reviews identified in 5101.170(b) are not required when the ODASA(P) conducts a special interest peer review for a procurement.</p>

<h4 id="routing-documents-and-mailing-addresses.">5101.290 Routing documents and mailing addresses.</h4>
<p>(a)(1) Contracting activities will obtain either head of the contracting activity (HCA) or, if delegated, SCO concurrence on all procurement document packages submitted for Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) review, coordination, and/or approval. The SCO may not delegate this authority. Procurement document packages will include all reviews and coordination completed prior to submission to HQDA, including legal reviews. Unless otherwise specified in this regulation, individual and class deviations to this AFARS provision are prohibited. Send document packages via the HQDA Task Management Tool (TMT) to the ODASA(P) pillar groups associated with the email addresses listed in 5101.290(b)(2)(ii)(C) (except as provided elsewhere in this regulation).</p>
<p>(2) The contracting officer shall include the contract type determination required by FAR 16.103(d)(1) and 5116.103(d)(1) in HQDA-level approval packages that reference contract type, including the approvals required by FAR 6.304 and FAR 16.504(c)(1)(D)(<em>1</em>). If a written acquisition plan is required for the associated contract action, include the acquisition plan in the submission package and provide the acquisition plan citation in the applicable paragraph of the document submitted for review. If a written acquisition plan is not required, include the contract type determination from the contract file in the submission package.</p>

<h4 id="policy.">5101.301 Policy.</h4>
<p>(a) The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (DASA(P)) acts for the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) in developing, coordinating, issuing and maintaining the AFARS.</p>
<p>(b) SCOs will coordinate with the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (ODASA(P)) Procurement Policy Pillar, SAAL-PP, to publish proposed internal acquisition regulations or instructions, policy letters, clause books, policies, procedures, clauses, or forms in the <em>Federal Register</em> for public comment when required. (See FAR 1.301(b) and DFARS 201.301(b).) Contracting activities will format coordination packages in accordance with FAR 1.304, DFARS 201.304, and 5101.304 and route them in accordance with 5101.290. SAAL-PP will assist the contracting activity with preparing the proposed notice, forward it to the <em>Federal Register</em>, and receive public comments. At the close of the public comment period, SAAL-PP will send all public comments to the contracting activity for analysis. When the contracting activity completes its analysis, it will -</p>
<p>(1) Send an updated request for deviation in accordance with 5101.402; or</p>
<p>(2) Send an updated request for approval, which does not involve a deviation, in accordance with 5101.304(1)(i); and</p>
<p>(3) Include the results of the publication and analysis under the heading  IV Collaterals. </p>
<h4 id="publication-and-codification.">5101.303 Publication and codification.</h4>
<p>(a)(i) The Code of Federal Regulations codifies the AFARS under chapter 51, in Title 48.</p>
<p>(ii) To the extent possible, number all AFARS text, whether implemental or supplemental, as if it were implemental. Use supplemental numbering only when the text cannot be integrated intelligibly with its FAR or DFARS counterpart.</p>
<p>(A) The AFARS implemental numbering sequence is the same as the FAR except-</p>
<p><em>(1)</em> Insert the number  51  before the primary citation;</p>
<p><em>(2)</em> Insert  0  if the primary citation is to a single digit part number; and</p>
<p><em>(3)</em> When the text exceeds one paragraph, number subdivisions by skipping a unit in the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence.</p>
<p>(B) The AFARS supplemental numbering sequence is the same as the FAR except -</p>
<p><em>(1)</em> Insert the number  51  before the primary citation;</p>
<p><em>(2)</em> Insert  0  if the primary citation is to a single digit part number;</p>
<p><em>(3)</em> Add  90  to parts, subparts, sections, or subsections;</p>
<p><em>(4)</em> Add  S-90  to subdivisions; and</p>
<p><em>(5)</em> When the text exceeds one paragraph, number subdivisions without skipping a unit in the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence.</p>
<p>(D) Examples of AFARS implemental and supplemental numbering are in Tables 1-1 and 1-2 respectively:</p>
