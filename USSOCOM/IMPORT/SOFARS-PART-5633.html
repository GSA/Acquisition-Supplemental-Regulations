Copies of both shall be sent to legal counsel.</p>
<p class="List1">(b) Upon learning of an appeal to the ASBCA, the Contracting Officer shall comply with Rule 4 of the ASBCA Rules (<a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/appendix-a%E2%80%93armed-services-board-contract-appeals">DFARS Appendix A, Part 2</a>).
