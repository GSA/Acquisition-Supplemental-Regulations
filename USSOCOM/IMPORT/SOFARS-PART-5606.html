If another statutory authority applies that will strengthen the justification for other than full and open competition, it may be cited in Paragraph 8 of the J&amp;A.</p>
<p class="List1">(c) A full scale J&amp;A is not required for solicitations issued in accordance with <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/part-13-simplified-acquisition-procedures">FAR Part 13</a>, however the justification must be documented in the contract file.</p>
<p class="List1">(d) Follow the &ldquo;Justification and Approvals (J&amp;As) and Exception to Fair Opportunity&rdquo; review and approval thresholds found in <a href="https://sof.atl.socom.mil/sites/K/SOFARS_DCG/SOFARS/Attachment_5601-1.docx">5601-1</a></p>

<p><em>(Revised June 2018)</em></p>
<p class="List1">(a) A document entitled, "Amendment to Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition," may be prepared in lieu of a new J&amp;A using the same paragraph designations as the basic J&amp;A. Paragraphs of the basic J&amp;A not affected by the amendment should be annotated, "No Change." Multiple amendments should be numbered <span style="color:#000000 !important">sequentially. Changes from the approved J&amp;A should be clearly identified.</span><span style="color:#C00000 !important"> </span>The Contracting Officer shall submit a copy of the basic J&amp;A along with the amended J&amp;A to the appropriate approval level as listed in <a href="https://sof.atl.socom.mil/sites/K/SOFARS_DCG/SOFARS/Attachment_5601-1.docx">Attachment 5601-1</a><span style="color:#0000FF !important">. </span><span style="color:#000000 !important">A signed J&amp;A must be completed prior to award of the subject contract action.</span></p>

<p class="List2">(1) An increase resulting in an out of scope determination that was not originally contemplated in the J&amp;A (Note: If the RAO or KO need flexibility to approve an increase in quantity or price without amending the approved J&amp;A, the specific flexibilities desired (i.e. 20% variation) must be addressed in the original J&amp;A). </p>
<p class="List2"><span style="color:#000000 !important">(2)	The negotiated price increase causes the approval level authority to rise to a higher level. The approval authority may recommend changes to the J&amp;A and the contracting officer may accomplish these changes, or any other changes, by submitting change pages to the approval authority for inclusion in the final document.</span></p>
<p class="List2"><span style="color:#000000 !important">(3)	There is a change in the competitive strategy that would further reduce competition (Note: The KO shall jointly determine the impact of changes to the acquisition strategy with the contract attorney to ensure the change does not restrict competition or require a change to the justification).</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000 !important">There is a modification to the requirement that changes the basis for the justification. If the new effort is outside the scope of the original J&amp;A, the contracting officer shall submit an amended J&amp;A to the appropriate approving authority. The contracting action cannot be awarded until the amended J&amp;A is approved.</span></p>
<p class="List1">(c) If the statutory authority for other than full and open competition is no longer applicable, or a different statutory authority now applies, a new J&amp;A shall be completed.</p>
