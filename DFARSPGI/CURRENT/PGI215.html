 Evaluating supply chain risk requires review of the supply chain,

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<b><br/>
</b>(1)  Contracting officers must purchase supplies and
services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices.  The
Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA) (10 U.S.C. 2306a and 41 U.S.C.
chapter 35) requires offerors to submit certified<b> </b>cost or
pricing data if a procurement exceeds the TINA threshold and none of
the exceptions to certified<b> </b>cost or pricing data requirements
applies.  Under TINA, the contracting officer obtains accurate,
complete, and current data from offerors to establish a fair and
reasonable price (see FAR 15.403).  TINA also allows for a price
adjustment remedy if it is later found that a contractor did not
provide accurate, complete, and current data.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
(2)  When certified<b> </b>cost or pricing data are not
required, and the contracting officer does not have sufficient data
to determine price reasonableness, FAR 15.402(a)(2) requires the
offeror to provide whatever data the contracting officer needs in
order to determine fair and reasonable prices.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
(3)  Obtaining sufficient data from the offeror is particularly
critical in situations where an item is determined to be a commercial
item in accordance with FAR 2.101 and the contract is being awarded
on a sole source basis.  This includes commercial sales data of items
sold in similar quantities and, if such data<b> </b>is insufficient,
cost data to support the proposed price.</p>

<br/>
<i>(2)</i>  <i><u>Pricing Actions Reported</u></i>.  The intent
of this requirement is to report when a commercial item exception was
determined.  Therefore, the reporting of the commercial item
exceptions are for pricing actions at the point the contracting
officer makes a determination that the commercial item exception
applies.  For example—</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><br/>
				<u>Example
1</u>:  The contracting officer determined that a commercial item
exception applies for an entire indefinite-delivery
indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract and expected the subsequent
orders to exceed $19.5 million (based on the estimated maximum amount
for the IDIQ or other supportable estimate of future orders).  The
organization would report this in accordance with DFARS
<a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/215_4.htm#215.403-1">215.403-1</a>(c)(3)
for the period in which the IDIQ contract was awarded, and would
include the total dollar amount of subsequent orders under the
exception expected at the time of award. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><br/>
				<u>Example
2</u>:  The contracting officer awards an IDIQ contract with no
commercial item exceptions anticipated.  The contracting officer
later modifies the contract for an order that will meet commercial
item exceptions, and the subsequent order(s) are expected to exceed
$19.5 million.  Reporting (in the year the modification was issued)
will include this IDIQ contract, the amount of this order, and any
other expected future orders that will use the exception.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
<i>(i)</i>  For the above examples, after the contract is
reported as receiving the exception with expected awards over $19.5
million, there would be no further report, e.g., when a subsequent
order under that contract exceeds $19.5 million, because reporting
for that contract was already accomplished.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
<i>(ii)</i>  When explaining price reasonableness in accordance
with paragraph (c)(3)(B)<i>(1)</i>(6) of this subsection, if pricing
was accomplished when the IDIQ contract was awarded, also explain how
price reasonableness was determined.  In circumstances where pricing
will take place on the order at a future date, explain how pricing
techniques at FAR 15.404-1 will be used, including obtaining cost
data, if that is the</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
only way to determine price reasonableness.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
(4)  <i>Waivers</i>.  
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
(A)  <i>Exceptional case TINA waiver</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
<br/>
<i>(1)</i>  In determining that an exceptional case TINA waiver
is appropriate, the head of the contracting activity must exercise
care to ensure that the supplies or services could not be obtained
without the waiver and that the determination is clearly documented. 
<a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/policy/policyvault/2007-0195-DPAP.pdf">See
DPAP March 23, 2007, policy memorandum</a>.  The intent is not to
relieve entities that normally perform Government contracts subject
to TINA from an obligation to certify that cost or pricing data are
accurate, complete, and current.  Instead, waivers must be used
judiciously, in situations where the Government could not otherwise
obtain a needed item without a waiver.  A prime example would be when
a particular company offers an item that is essential to DoD s
mission but is not available from other sources, and the company
refuses to submit certified cost or pricing data.  In such cases, a
waiver may be appropriate.  However, the procuring agency should, in
conjunction with the waiver, develop a strategy for procuring the
item in the future that will not require such a waiver (e.g., develop
a second source, develop an alternative product that satisfies the
department s needs, or have DoD produce the item).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
<br/>
<i>(2)</i>  <i><u>Senior procurement executive coordination</u></i>.
 An exceptional case TINA waiver that exceeds $100 million shall be
coordinated with the senior procurement executive prior to granting
the waiver. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
<br/>
<i>(3)</i>  <i><u>Waiver for part of a proposal</u></i>.  The
requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data may be
waived for part of an offeror s proposed price when it is possible
to clearly identify that part of the offeror s cost proposal to
which the waiver applies as separate and distinct from the balance of
the proposal.  In granting a partial waiver, in addition to complying
with the requirements in DFARS <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/html/current/215_4.htm#215.403-1">215.403-1</a>(c)(4),
the head of the contracting activity must address why it is in the
Government s best interests to grant a partial waiver, given that
the offeror has no objection to certifying to the balance of its cost
proposal.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">
<br/>
<i>(4)</i>  <i><u>Waivers for unpriced supplies or services</u></i>.
 Because there is no price, unpriced supplies or services cannot be
subject to cost or pricing data certification requirements.  The
Government cannot agree in advance to waive certification
requirements for unpriced supplies or services, and may only consider
a waiver at such time as an offeror proposes a price that would
otherwise be subject to certification requirements.</p>

</span>(4)  <i>Reliance on
prior prices paid by the Government</i>.  Before relying on a prior
price paid by the Government, the contracting officer must verify and
document that sufficient analysis was performed to determine that the
prior price was fair and reasonable.  Sometimes, due to exigent
situations, supplies or services are purchased even though an
adequate price or cost analysis could not be performed.  The problem
is exacerbated when other contracting officers assume these prices
were adequately analyzed and determined to be fair and reasonable. 
The contracting officer also must verify that the prices previously
paid were for quantities consistent with the current solicitation. 
Not verifying that a previous analysis was performed, or the
consistencies in quantities, has been a recurring issue on sole
source commercial items reported by oversight organizations.  Sole
source commercial items require extra attention to verify that
previous prices paid on Government contracts were sufficiently
analyzed and determined to be fair and reasonable.  At a minimum, a
contracting officer reviewing price history shall discuss the basis
of previous prices paid with the contracting organization that
previously bought the item.  These discussions shall be documented in
the contract file.</p>

<b><br/>
</b>(a)  <i>General</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
(i)  The objective of proposal analysis is to ensure that the
final agreed-to price is fair 
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%">and
reasonable.  
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
(A)  When the contracting officer needs data to determine price
reasonableness and the offeror will not furnish that data, use the
following sequence of steps to resolve the issue:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>
(<i>i</i>)
 The contracting officer should make it clear what data is required
and why it is needed to determine fair and reasonable prices, and
should be flexible in requesting data in existing formats with
appropriate explanations from the offeror.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>
(<i>ii</i>)
 If the offeror refuses to provide the data, the contracting officer
should elevate the issue within the contracting activity.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>
(<i>iii</i>)
 Contracting activity management shall, with support from the
contracting officer, discuss the issue with appropriate levels of the
offeror s management.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>
(<i>iv</i>)
 If the offeror continues to refuse to provide the data, contracting
activity management shall elevate the issue to the head of the
contracting activity for a decision in accordance with FAR
15.403-3(a)(4).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>
(<i>v</i>)
 The contracting officer shall document the contract file to
describe—</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">

data;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
<i>(b)</i>  Why there is currently no other alternative but to
procure the item from this particular source; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
<i>(c)</i>  A written plan for avoiding this situation in the
future (e.g., develop a second source by...; bring the procurement in
house to the Government by...).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>
(<i>vi</i>)
 Consistent with the requirements at FAR 15.304 and 42.1502 and the
DoD Guide to Collection and Use of Past Performance Information,
Version 3, dated May 2003, the contracting officer shall provide
input into the past performance system, noting the offeror s
refusal to provide the requested information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
(B)  In some cases, supplies or services that are not subject
to TINA may require a cost analysis (see paragraph (b)(iv) of this
section).  This will occur when a price analysis is not sufficient
for determining prices to be fair and reasonable.  In such cases, the
contracting officer should consider the need for a Defense Contract
Audit Agency audit of the cost data.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
(C)  Particular attention should be paid to sole source commercial
supplies or services.  While the order of preference at FAR 15.402
must be followed, if the contracting officer cannot determine price
reasonableness without obtaining data other than cost or pricing data
from the offeror, at a minimum, the contracting officer must obtain
appropriate data on the prices at which the same or similar items
have been sold previously (often previous sales data was the basis of
the commercial item determination and must be requested during price
analysis of the data provided by the offeror).  If previous sales
data is not sufficient to determine price reasonableness, the
contracting officer must obtain  data other than certified cost or
pricing data  and, if necessary, perform a cost analysis.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>
(D)  Analysis of termination proposals, including termination
of any contract scope, should not rely solely on earned value
management budgets or estimates for estimating the costs of all work
d, or the cost of deleted work already performed (reference FAR
subpart 15.4, Table 15-2—Instructions for Submitting Cost/Price
Proposals When Certified Cost or Pricing Data are Required, columns
(2) and (3) of section III.B., Change Orders, Modifications, and
Claims).</p>

<br/>
(v)  Contracting officers must obtain and document sufficient
data to confirm that previous prices paid by the Government were
based on a thorough price and/or cost analysis.  For example, it
would not be sufficient to use price(s) from a database paid by
another contracting officer without understanding the type of
analysis that was performed to determine the price(s), and without
verifying that the quantities were similar for pricing purposes. 
This does not necessarily need to be another analysis, but there
should be<b> </b>coordination with the other office that acknowledges
an analysis was performed previously.</p>

(e)  <i>Technical analysis</i>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 108%"><br/>
	Requesting
technical assistance is particularly important when evaluating
pricing related to items that are  similar to  items being
purchased or commercial items that are  of a type  or require
 minor modifications.   Technical analysis can assist in pricing
these types of items by identifying any differences between the item
being acquired and the  similar to  item.  In particular, the
technical review can assist in evaluating the changes that are
required to get from the  similar to  item, to the item being
solicited, so the contracting officer can determine sufficient
price/cost analysis techniques when evaluating that the price for the
item being solicited is fair and reasonable.  See the Department of

<br/>
(i)  When obtaining field pricing assistance on a prime
contractor s proposal, the contracting officer should request audit
or field pricing assistance to analyze and evaluate the proposal of a
subcontractor at any tier (notwithstanding availability of data or
analyses performed by the prime contractor) if the contracting
officer believes that such assistance is necessary to ensure the
reasonableness of the total proposed price.  Such assistance may be
appropriate when, for example<font face="Symbol, serif"></font></p>

<br/>
(D)  The contracting officer determines that, because of
factors such as the size of the proposed subcontract price, audit or
field pricing assistance for a subcontract at any tier is critical to
a fully detailed analysis of the prime contractor s proposal;</p>

<br/>
(ii)  It may be appropriate for the contracting officer or the
ACO to provide assistance to a contractor or subcontractor at any
tier, when the contractor or higher-tier subcontractor has been
denied access to a subcontractor s records in carrying out the
responsibilities at FAR 15.404-3 to conduct price or cost analysis to
determine the reasonableness of proposed subcontract prices.  Under
these circumstances, the contracting officer or the ACO should
consider whether providing audit or field pricing assistance will
serve a valid Government interest.</p>

(iii)  When DoD performs the subcontract analysis, DoD shall
furnish to the prime contractor or higher-tier subcontractor, with
the consent of the subcontractor reviewed, a summary of the analysis
performed in determining any unacceptable costs included in the
subcontract proposal.  If the subcontractor withholds consent, DoD
shall furnish a range of unacceptable costs for each element in such
a way as to prevent disclosure of subcontractor proprietary data.</p>

may include subcontracts placed on the same basis.  When the
contracting officer wants to reprice the prime contract even though
the contractor has not yet established final prices for the

considered when determining whether a review will be conducted. 
Overhead should-cost reviews generally should not be conducted at a
contractor business segment more frequently than every 3 years.</p>
