<p><strong>(h)(4)(90) Pre-contract Costs</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) Pre-contract cost agreements should be reviewed for legal sufficiency (see AFMC PGI 5331.109(h)(4)(90)(b) for a sample Pre-contract Cost Agreement). As a condition precedent to the use of a pre-contract cost agreement, the correct type of funds should be available upon issuance of the pre-contract cost agreement. While not legally necessary, prudent business acumen would dictate, that to the maximum extent possible, agreement on terms and conditions also be established prior to issuance of a pre-contract cost agreement. Contracting officers should consult with the designated clearance approval authority prior to agreement on pre-contract costs. The contracting officer should incorporate the pre-contract cost agreement into any resultant contract as an attachment within Section J.</p>
<p>(b) The pre-contract cost agreement may be written as follows and should include the following minimum essential content:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Subject to approval as required by law and regulation, the undersigned agree to include a clause in any contract resulting from negotiations with (<span class="underline">insert company name</span>) under (<span class="underline">insert solicitation number</span>) that all costs not in excess of $(<span class="underline">insert dollar amount</span>) incurred by the prospective contractor after (<span class="underline">insert date</span>), and before the contract effective date, shall be recognized the same as if incurred after the effective date of the resulting contract.</em></p>
<p><em>The parties agree that the Government shall not accept any benefit of the prospective contractor s efforts, give no direction or encouragement, and make no payments until a contract is awarded. If no contract results from these negotiations, the prospective contractor is responsible for any incurred costs. Any incurred costs shall not be used as the basis of a claim against, or construed as an obligation of the Government. (<span class="underline">Include any specific cost categories and any other limiting details</span>).</em></p>
