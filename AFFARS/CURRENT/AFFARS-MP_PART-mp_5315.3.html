<p class="List1"><strong>1.1   Purpose </strong></p>
<p>This Mandatory Procedure (MP) establishes supplemental procedures for conducting competitively negotiated source selections of $10M or more within the Air Force (AF), and follows the numbering convention of the <a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/policy/policyvault/USA004370-14-DPAP.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>Department of Defense (DoD) Source Selection Procedures</em></span></a>, dated 31 Mar 2016.</p>
<p class="List1"><strong>1.2   Applicability and Waivers</strong> </p>
<p>This MP must be used in conjunction with FAR 15, as supplemented, to include the DoD Source Selection Procedures, related law, regulation, and policy. <strong>As guidance, this MP also provides hyperlinks to best practices, tailored RFP and contract language, tailorable templates for use as desired, and training material, as well as links to PGI 5315.3 language.</strong></p>
<p class="List3"><span style="color:#000000 !important">1.2.1.1   Acquisitions with an estimated dollar value less than or equal to $50M may use price as the only evaluated factor and therefore be exempt from the DoD Source Selection Procedures dated 31 March 2016 and from this MP if all of the following conditions are met:  </span></p>
<p class="PlainText"><span style="color:#000000 !important">1)  The requirement is non-complex and well-defined, such that consideration of non-cost/price evaluation factors (e.g., technical, past performance, etc.) would not provide any meaningful differentiation amongst proposals and would add no value to the selection of a successful offeror;</span></p>
<p class="PlainText"><span style="color:#000000 !important">2)  Past performance record and history will be assessed as one of the multiple standards required for a successful offeror to be determined responsible as described </span>in <em>FAR 9.104</em><span style="color:#000000 !important">; </span></p>
<p class="PlainText"><span style="color:#000000 !important">3)  Use of price as the only evaluation factor is the most advantageous approach to the government; and</span></p>
<p class="PlainText"><span style="color:#000000 !important">4)  The acquisition strategy approving official has determined that use of price as the only evaluated factor is the most appropriate source selection methodology for the requirement and the justification for this determination is included in the approved acquisition strategy/plan.  </span></p>
<p class="List3">1.2.1.2 A waiver allowing the use of price as the only evaluated factor for an acquisition with an estimated dollar value greater than $50M may be granted on an acquisition specific basis by the SCO upon the waiver authority&rsquo;s determination that the conditions at 1.2.1.1 (1)-(4) are met.</p>
<p class="List2">1.2.4<strong>   </strong>Waivers.<strong> </strong>Waivers for solicitations valued at $1B or more for approval by the Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting (DPC), must be forwarded through the SCO to <a href="mailto:SAF.AQ.SAF-AQC.Workflow@us.af.mil">SAF/AQC</a> for review and processing. Waivers for solicitations above $10M but less than $1B must be approved by the SCO. </p>
<p class="List3">1.2.4.1. Waiver procedures apply only to the DoD Source Selection Procedures and this MP. The requirements of <em>FAR 15.3</em>, as supplemented, cannot be waived as these requirements are subject to the FAR deviation process. Deviation approval levels are set forth in <a href="[rp:link:affars-part-5301]#p5301403">AFFARS 5301.403(1)(ii))</a> and <a href="[rp:link:affars-part-5301]#p5301404">5301.404(b)</a>(i).</p>

Source selection material must not be removed, circulated, or disseminated outside of the source selection work area without PCO review and approval. Ensure all means of electronic communications receive additional scrutiny to preclude inadvertent release of documents that contain sensitive or embedded source selection files. Prior to transmission of Source Selection Information to offerors via any means, the information should be reviewed by a second person to preclude inadvertent inclusion of inappropriate data. Additionally, Source Selection Information transmitted to offerors electronically (e.g., via email or disc) or posted to a website must be distributed in a &ldquo;locked&rdquo; format, such as scanned .pdf file, .jpeg file, or other protected format. An exception to the format requirement is when offerors are required to fill-in or complete portions of a document, such as Section K Representations and Certifications, or a pricing matrix. Using e-mail to transmit source selection information should be done judiciously and it must be encrypted and digitally signed.

<p class="List3">2.3.4.1 Cost or Price. The analysis technique(s) identified in FAR 15.404,<span style="color:#FF6600 !important"> </span>as supplemented, for the evaluation of the proposed cost or price shall be included in the evaluation criteria (Section M or equivalent provisions of the solicitation for commercial acquisitions).</p>
<p class="List4">2.3.4.1.1 When used, the Probable Cost estimate is the government estimate of the cost to acquire specified goods and/or services based on each offeror&rsquo;s proposed approach. The Probable Cost is based upon an analysis of each offeror&rsquo;s unique proposal in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). Define all the components that make up the aggregate government Probable Cost and specify them in Section M (or equivalent provisions of the solicitation for commercial acquisitions). </p>
<p class="List4">2.3.4.2.4 Affordability Cap. When an affordability cap is established, the affordability cap must be specified in the RFP and affordability must be included either as a go/no go gate or as an evaluation criterion in the RFP. The RFP must state whether proposals that exceed the affordability cap can be considered for award.</p>
<p class="List2">2.3.6. Requirements that fall within the areas of traditional offeror responsibility factors may trigger the Small Business Administration Certificate of Competency (CoC) process if such requirements are evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis, as a rating of unacceptable for an otherwise apparently successful business offeror equates to a non-responsibility determination. For example, issues related to facility clearance/security requirements or evaluation of professional employee compensation as an element of responsibility are areas that may trigger the CoC process for small business offerors. PCOs should consult with small business and legal counsel regarding the use and treatment of such evaluation factors/subfactors.<a id="P245_17059"></a><a id="p41"></a><a id="_Ref59348021"></a></p>

<p class="List3">3.1.1.5 When <em>FAR 52.222-46</em>, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees (Feb 1993), is included in the RFP, the Government shall evaluate whether all offerors considered for award understand the contract requirements and have proposed a compensation plan appropriate for those requirements. This evaluation may be accomplished through a technical subfactor to evaluate offerors&rsquo; proposed management approach and or/staffing plan, or including the evaluation under the cost/price factor or as a &ldquo;Volume I&rdquo; proposal submission and element of proposal compliance and offeror responsibility. </p>
<p class="List4">3.1.1.5.1 When including the professional employee compensation evaluation as a &ldquo;Volume I&rdquo; proposal submission and element of proposal compliance and offeror responsibility in a source selection with small business offerors, a finding of non-responsibility due to an inadequate professional employee compensation plan for an otherwise successful small business offeror requires the PCO to engage the Small Business Administration Certificate of Competency (CoC) process.</p>

<p class="List1"><strong>6.1   Purpose</strong></p>
<p>This Section establishes and standardizes the mandatory Air Force source selection training process for acquisition/SSTs. </p>
<p class="List1"><strong>6.2   Responsibilities of Senior Contracting Officials (SCO)</strong></p>
<p>SCOs must: (a) implement a robust source selection training program; (b) designate a Training Manager/Point of Contact (POC); and (c) designate experienced source selection<span style="color:#00B050 !important"> t</span>rainers and provide current lists of the Training Managers/POCs and trainers to the <a href="mailto:SAF.AQ.MLA.DF.SAF-AQCP.FIELD.SUPPORT@us.af.mil">SAF/AQC Field Support Team</a>. The lists should be updated as necessary, but at a minimum shall be updated annually.<span style="color:#00B050 !important">  </span>See the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/templates/designation_of_ss_trng_mgrs_and_trainers.pdf"><em>Designation of Source Selection Training Manager/Trainers</em></a> template.</p>
<p class="List1"><strong>6.3   Required Training for Designated Trainers </strong></p>
<p class="List2">6.3.1 Designated trainers must receive &ldquo;Train-the-Trainer&rdquo; training and be certified as source selection trainers by SAF/AQC, per paragraph 6.6. Periodic &ldquo;Train-the-Trainer&rdquo; sessions can be arranged directly with the <a href="mailto:SAF.AQ.MLA.DF.SAF-AQCP.FIELD.SUPPORT@us.af.mil">SAF/AQC Field Support Team</a>. This training is provided to designated trainers and shall not be used by source selection teams and other individuals to satisfy the source selection training requirements set forth in paragraph 6.4.1.</p>
<p class="List2">6.3.2 Training Managers/POCs must maintain a record of the source selection training provided by designated trainers, including the name of the acquisition, training date, names of individuals trained, and training provided (e.g., Phase I (Acquisition Planning) or Phase II (Source Selection Execution) training). </p>
<p class="List2">6.3.3 Designated trainers who have not conducted source selection training within a two (2) year period must be recertified by SAF/AQC. Recertification requires that the SCO confirm the individual&rsquo;s continued designation as a source selection trainer and that the individual re-complete the SAF/AQC &ldquo;Train-the-Trainer&rdquo; training.</p>
<p class="List1"><strong>6.4   Acquisition/Source Selection Team Training</strong> </p>
<p class="List2">6.4.1 Conducting Source Selection Training Sessions.</p>
<p>Source selection training must be presented to the entire SST, including the SSA, SSAC Chair and members, PM (where one is assigned), RO,<span style="color:#00B050 !important"> </span>and all advisors. Independent review of source selection training materials by SST members and/or attendance at SAF/AQC &ldquo;Train-the-Trainer&rdquo; training is not sufficient to satisfy this training requirement.</p>
<p>&#9679; Specialized executive level training modules are available for the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/source_selection_training/SSA_SS_Training_Charts.pptx" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>SSA</em></span></a> and <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/source_selection_training/SSAC_SS_Training_Charts.pptx" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>SSAC</em></span></a>. </p>
<p>&#9679; <strong>Phase I</strong> (Acquisition Planning)<span style="color:#00B050 !important"> </span>training should be presented at the earliest stage of an acquisition and covers the acquisition process up to release of the RFP. </p>
<p>&#9679; <strong>Phase II </strong>(Source Selection Execution)<span style="color:#00B050 !important"> </span>training is presented prior to or immediately after receipt of proposals.</p>
<p class="List2">6.4.2 Training Content and Process.</p>
<p>SAF/AQC develops and maintains source selection training modules to assist Source Selection Trainers. Trainers are encouraged to tailor the modules, as needed, to meet the unique elements of the instant acquisition.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ethics, Procurement Integrity, and Conflicts of Interest</strong> topic should be presented by the local legal advisor. Links to Ethics training material are included in both Phase I and Phase II source selection training materials. The use of locally-developed Ethics training by local legal advisors is encouraged. The length of the source selection training and the level of detail presented in either Phase I (Acquisition Planning)<span style="color:#00B050 !important"> </span>or Phase II (Source Selection Execution) depends on the complexity of the specific acquisition and the experience level of the SST.</p>
<p class="List2">6.4.3 Advance Preparation.</p>
<p>Effectiveness of the source selection training experience can be enhanced with advance preparation. The Defense Acquisition University (DAU) offers <a href="http://icatalog.dau.mil/onlinecatalog/tabnavcl.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>continuous learning modules</em></span></a> on source selection and related topics.
