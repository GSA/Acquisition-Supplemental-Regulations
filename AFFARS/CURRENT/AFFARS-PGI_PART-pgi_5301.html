<a id="_AF_PGI_5301.9001(b)_1"></a>AF PGI 5301.9001(b) Clearance: Multi-Functional Independent Review Teams</h3>
<p class="List1"><strong>1. Objective.  </strong>The use of<strong> </strong>multi-functional independent review teams (MIRT) is considered a best practice for high dollar value or complex competitive acquisitions. MIRTs conduct independent reviews to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the competitive contracting process, and may facilitate cross-sharing of best practices and lessons learned. The MIRT operates in an advisory capacity in its assessment of the acquisition approach employed, and the consistency and sufficiency of the source selection team products.</p>
<p class="List1"><strong>2. Guidelines.</strong><a id="_Ref58383052"></a><strong>  </strong>To promote an understanding of the MIRT process and to ensure the process is value added, the CAA and SSA should establish the rules of engagement for the MIRT (e.g., how many reviews are planned, the expected duration of each review, and what is required to close MIRT comments prior to the CAA granting clearance, as well as the relationship between the clearance process and source selection process events).</p>
<p class="List1"><strong>3. Typical MIRT Process.</strong></p>
<p class="List2"><strong>3.1.</strong> The CAA should establish an independent and objective process, tailored to the needs of the acquisition, employing cross-functional subject matter experts (SME) with source selection experience and knowledge of current source selection procedures. The CAA should ensure that the established review process encourages frank and open discussion among MIRT members concerning their observations and recommendations.</p>
<p class="List2"><strong>3.2. </strong>For maximum benefit, MIRTs should be formed at the beginning of an acquisition with membership agreed to by the CAA. When the DAS(C) or ADAS(C) is the CAA, the SCO may appoint the MIRT and interact with the SSA as needed. Recommended team members include the Technical/Requirements Activity, Legal, Contracting, Finance/Cost, Small Business, and participants from other specialized areas as needed. A member from the SAF/AQCP Field Support Team may be requested to participate on MIRTs when DAS(C) or ADAS(C) is the CAA or on a case-by-case basis. Submit requests for SAF/AQCP participation to <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-aq.mbx.saf-aqcp-workflow@mail.mil?subject=MIRT Support Request">SAF/AQCP</a>. <sup></sup>To promote consistency, the same MIRT members should participate in each critical decision point review for the duration of the acquisition unless otherwise agreed to by the CAA. To prevent bias, MIRT members should not be members of the source selection team. The use of contractors on a MIRT is discouraged. </p>
<p class="List1"><strong>4. Critical Decision Points (CDP).</strong> The CAA and SSA typically determine the CDPs, or other focus areas, to be reviewed by the MIRT for each acquisition. The CDPs below are examples of opportunities for MIRT activity. CDPs 1 and 2 would occur prior to the request for Business Clearance, and CDPs 3, 4 and 5 would occur prior to request for Contract Clearance. </p>
<p><strong>CDP#1:</strong> Review draft ASP Brief or review of draft Acquisition Plan (AP). (Includes review of requirements documents, results of market research and risk assessment, and incentive structure, as applicable.) </p>
<p><strong>CDP#2:</strong> Review Sections L and M of the Request for Proposal (RFP). (Includes review of Source Selection Plan, requirements documents, and other portions of the solicitation, as necessary, to ensure executable evaluation criteria.)</p>
<p><strong>CDP#3:</strong> Review draft Initial Evaluation/Competitive Range Brief or review of draft Award without Discussions Brief. (Review of these draft briefs includes review of supporting documentation and evaluation notices or interim ratings, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>CDP#4:</strong> Review draft Final Proposal Revision (FPR) Request. (Review of this draft brief includes review of pre-FPR brief including interim ratings after discussions, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>CDP#5:</strong> Review draft Source Selection Decision briefing. (Review of this draft brief includes review of the Source Selection Evaluation Board Report, Source Selection Advisory Council Comparative Analysis Report and Award Recommendation, etc.)</p>
<p class="List1"><strong>5.  MIRT Work Product.</strong> The MIRT typically out briefs the source selection team at the conclusion of each MIRT review conducted, and an assessment to the CAA on the state of the acquisition. The MIRT assessment and contracting officer disposition of MIRT comments/recommendations may be included with the applicable Business and Contract Clearance requests at the CAA&rsquo;s discretion. Contracting officers should advise the CAA of any unresolved MIRT comments. The SSA should be provided a copy of MIRT reports for their information and use as appropriate. </p>

<p>In accordance with <a href="http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/saf_ig/publication/afi90-201/afi90-201.pdf"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>AFI 90-201, <em>The Air Force Inspection System</em></em></span></a> and AFFARS MP5301.601-91, <em>Air Force Contracting Self-Inspection Program</em>, all contracting offices/squadrons will have a Self-Inspection Program (SIP) that assesses contract files and management programs. This PGI establishes the standardized process for performing self-inspections of contract actions/files and support the Unit Self-Assessment Program Managers (USAPMs) in the completion of both the <em>Air Force Contracting Self-Assessment Communicator</em> (AQC 2) and <em>Air Force Operational Contracting Self-Assessment Communicator for Operational Contracting Squadrons Only</em> (AQC 3), both of which are found in the <a href="https://mict.us.af.mil/mymict.aspx"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em><em>Management Internal Control Toolset</em> (MICT)</em></span></a> system.</p>
<p>Each contracting office/squadron is responsible for ensuring their contract actions reflect good business judgment and comply with applicable statutes, regulations and policies. The self-inspection process includes the selection of previously awarded and/or completed contract actions, both above and below prescribed clearance review thresholds, for review by the office/squadron&rsquo;s Self-Inspection Program (SIP) Team. Through review of previous contract actions and gap analysis, the identification of best practices, trends or areas of concern (AOCs) should result in recommendations for sharing lessons learned, recommended areas for improvement (i.e., RIAs) and/or the development of corrective action plans (CAPs). The process is iterative and requires proactive trend and issue identification with the goal of improving the quality of the resultant contract files as well as the overall acquisition health of the unit. </p>
<p>Commanders/Directors appoint a Unit Self-Inspection Program Manager (USIPM) with overall responsibility for the self-inspection process to include use of appropriate checklists, worksheets or other tools, collation of self-inspection data, completion of the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/affars_pgi_related_documents/unit_self-inspection_report.docx">Unit Self-Inspection Report</a> and submission of the report to the cognizant senior functional (contracting) leadership. Based on the volume and complexity of actions to be reviewed, the USIPM assigns an appropriate number of assessors to complete the self-inspection, to include entry of all required data into the appropriate <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/affars_pgi_related_documents/self-inspection_worksheet.xlsx">self-inspection worksheets</a> and <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/affars_pgi_related_documents/reviewers_checklist.xlsx">checklists</a>, analysis of self-inspection data (including subjective observations/comments), culminated by the completion of the written report. </p>
<p>The USIPM and assigned assessors should possess the minimum requisite skill level of APDP Level II in Contracting and have no less than five years of experience in the contracting career field. When required, the USIPM/SIP Team will brief the results of the self-inspection, to include open observations, corrective actions, repeat findings and all pertinent information to the COCO and/or SCO or designee (reporting requirements are determined by the SCO). </p>
<p>SIP Teams should assess contract actions/files using the applicable portions of the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/templates/self_inspection_checklist.xlsx">Air Force Contracting Self-Inspection Checklist</a> and whenever possible, teams should utilize the self-inspection capability of <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/11191/KTFSApp/app/index.aspx#!/home"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>KT FileShare</em></span></a> to assist them in completing the Unit Self-Inspection Report.

The contracting officer typically allows at least 5 business days after receipt of a complete clearance request package by the cognizant AFICC reviewing office for completion of a clearance review. Clearance request packages received after 1300 local time should be logged as received the following business day. Additionally, contracting officers should anticipate approximately 3 additional business days for Clearance Approval Authority (CAA) review. Clearance Reviews should be accomplished using <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/11191/KTFSApp/app/index.aspx#!/contracts">KT FileShare</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Business and Contract Clearance Approvals</strong></p>
<p>Prior to requesting clearance, the contracting officer should ensure all required clearance documentation is uploaded to <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/11191/KTFSApp/app/index.aspx#!/contracts">KT FileShare</a>, followed by an e-mail to the cognizant AFICC OL workflow account requesting assignment of a Clearance Reviewer. When the CAA requires Clearance briefing charts, contracting officers may use the AFFARS template, AFICC template, or a locally developed template. Competitive RFP amendments should be reviewed and approved by the CAA prior to issuance (not applicable to administrative changes).</p>
<p><strong>Noncompetitive Contract Actions</strong></p>
<p>Unless otherwise exempted, a Preliminary-Price Negotiation Memorandum (P-PNM) is typically used to explain the rationale applied to arrive at the Government objective by cost element. For purposes of the clearance process, Architect-Engineering Services should be handled as noncompetitive acquisitions. Business clearance approval is required prior to beginning negotiations with the contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive Contract Actions</strong></p>
<p>For competitive Contract Clearance the CAA may be invited to the SSA briefing.</p>
<p><strong>Clearance Exclusions</strong></p>
<p>Unless otherwise prohibited, when excluding task or delivery orders from business or contract clearance, Contracting officers typically document their clearance exclusion decision, the record of which should be included in the contract file for every order. Contracting officers may utilize the Fair Opportunity Order Clearance Exclusion MFR template (not yet uploaded to <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/affars_pgi_related_documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx">PGI Library</a>) to exclude an order from business or contract clearance.<a id="_AFICC_PGI_5301.9001"></a></p>

All reviews in the self-inspection should be conducted on a representative sampling of actions (e.g., purchase orders, contracts, supplemental agreements, undefinitized contract actions, funding modifications, orders, option exercises, assistance instruments, etc.). Additionally, specific actions may be selected (outside of random sample) due to the high visibility, or uniqueness of a given acquisition. </p>
<p class="List1">While buying organizations should also conduct reviews for their own internal quality control/proactive improvement, those reviews are separate from the self-inspection addressed by this process. However, organizations are encouraged to provide such results to the Contracting Office for sharing of lessons learned/trend analysis/correct. PZC may allow for buying office augmentation of reviews. Augmentation may also be used for those organizations who do not have a resident PZC, and virtual inspection is not practicable. </p>

This PGI establishes the standardized process for performing self-inspections of contract actions/files and support the AFRC Chief of Contracting in the completion of both the&nbsp;<em>Air Force Contracting Self-Assessment Communicator</em>&nbsp;(AQC 2) and&nbsp;<em>Air Force Operational Contracting Self-Assessment Communicator for Operational Contracting Squadrons Only</em>&nbsp;(AQC 3), both of which are found in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://mict.us.af.mil/mymict.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em><em>Management Internal Control Toolset </em>(MICT)</em></span></a><span style="color:#000000 !important">&nbsp;system.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000 !important">Each contracting office is responsible for ensuring its contract actions reflect good business judgment and comply with applicable statutes, regulations and policies. The self-inspection process includes the selection of previously awarded and/or completed contract actions, both above and below prescribed clearance review thresholds, for review by the office&rsquo;s Self-Inspection Program (SIP) Team. Through review of previous contract actions and gap analysis, the identification of best practices, trends or areas of concern (AOCs) should result in recommendations for sharing lessons learned, recommended areas for improvement (i.e., RIAs) and/or the development of corrective action plans (CAPs). The process is iterative and requires proactive trend and issue identification with the goal of improving the quality of the resultant contract files as well as the overall acquisition health of the unit.</span></p>
<p> The Chief of Contracting (COCO) is responsible for the Contracting Office&rsquo;s overall Self-Inspection Program, which includes both the assessment of individual contract files and the assessment of contracting management programs.

<p class="List4">(A) Program attorneys should use the following terminology when documenting legal review:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="List6">(1) Legally sufficient</p>
<p class="List6">(2) Legally sufficient, subject to [insert comments]</p>
<p class="List6">(3) Legally insufficient [insert rationale]</p>
<p class="List6">(4) Coordination withheld [insert rationale]&nbsp;</p>
<p class="List6">(5) Other comments/administrative comments&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="List6">(<em>6</em>) If the legal reviewer has not clearly labeled the review using the terminology above, or you do not agree with the categorization of the comments, politely challenge the reviewer. If you cannot resolve the issue with the reviewer, elevate it through leadership chain quickly so that it does not linger and delay your action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) Other Reviews. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="List4">(A) Contracting officers obtain Committee and Pricing reviews as directed by regulation, the COCO, or SMC/PK.</p>
<p class="List4">(B) Legal, committee, and pricing reviews may be done in parallel.</p>
<p class="List4">(C) Contracting officers may, in coordination with reviewers, decide the appropriate method for submitting review requests if done outside the <a href="https://insidesmc.losangeles.af.mil/sites/pk/div/pkc/requests/Lists/committee/AllItems.aspx">Review Request</a> application.</p>
<p class="List6">(1) Contracting officers may provide a link to the Livelink or SharePoint file in the &ldquo;Program Description&rdquo; field of the review request form. Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that the electronic files are named and organized in such a fashion that can easily be understood and accessed by the reviewer. Files that are not clearly named or well-organized may be returned without review.<br><br> (2) If documents are sensitive (e.g., source selection information) and the contracting officer does not want to upload them to Livelink or SharePoint, the contracting officer provides alternate instructions for access to the documentation in the &ldquo;Program Description&rdquo; field of the review request form. Note: The Buyer and PCO Library site is maintained by the SMC/PK Advisory and Assistance Services contractor.</p>
<p class="List4">(D) The contracting officer should consider, for final documentation purposes, addressing each review comment and include rationale for partially accepted or rejected comments. Contracting officers are highly encouraged to discuss with the reviewer any critical and substantive comments that are partially accepted or rejected. These comments should also be discussed during the clearance review, if applicable.</p>
<p class="List4">(E) In determining what constitutes a complete file for review, contracting professionals should:</p>
<p class="List6">(1) Review the Contract File Content Index. Determine what documentation can be completed at this time. If there is enough information to generate the documentation at this point in the process, the documentation should be in the file.</p>
<p class="List6"> (2) Consider adding a note to the review request form or in the contract file explaining any missing documentation. While it is the expectation that files submitted for review be complete (based on what is appropriate for the current milestone), there are times when it may be necessary or in the best interest of the acquisition to proceed with a less than complete file. If the reviewer knows that you made a conscious decision to proceed without a complete file, this note gives them the opportunity to consider your rationale and make a more informed recommendation to you and the CAA. It may avoid the impression that you have been sloppy in your work. And, it may reduce the amount of comments that need to be written and adjudicated.</p>
<p class="List4">(F) Build the acquisition schedule with sufficient time for review.&nbsp; SMC/PK<span style="color:#538135 !important"><em>C</em></span> and SMC/JAQ have each established an internal review goal of 3 business days for most reviews. However, large files (e.g., draft RFPs) or matters requiring substantial research and analysis may take longer, so plan accordingly. You can expedite the review process by:</p>
<p class="List6"> (1) Providing a complete, well-researched, well-documented, and well-organized file.&nbsp; Files that are incomplete, poorly researched or poorly documented, or unorganized may delay the review and result in additional or duplicative work on the part of the contracting officer.&nbsp;The review window does not start until the file is complete so it is imperative to deliver a complete file up-front.</p>
<p class="List6"> (2) Involving your reviewers throughout the planning and execution of the action.&nbsp; When reviewers are familiar with the action, it is easier for them to review the file and they can often complete their reviews faster.</p>
<p class="List6"> (3) Looking at your file through the eyes of the reviewer who has not been as intimately involved in the action as you.&nbsp; Are there areas that might require a little more explanation?</p>
<p class="List6"> (4) Engaging reviewers early where there is an issue of doubt or controversy. Offer to walk the reviewer through the file briefly so that you can explain any areas that might be unusual, confusing, or controversial.</p>
<p class="List6"> (5) Contracting officers should carefully consider the appropriateness of parallel review for certain actions. There may be cases where it would be more beneficial to use a serial review approach to minimize the total number of comments to adjudicate or avoid other unnecessary confusion or rework.</p>
<p class="List6"> (6) Requesting that your reviewers, including legal, get together to deconflict their comments before providing them to the contracting officer or buyer. In a parallel review process, it is highly likely that you may receive conflicting advice from your reviewers. It may be beneficial to have the reviewers go over their comments together with the intent of trying to resolve disagreements before you go through each set of comments individually.</p>
<p class="List6"> (7) Providing timely and complete adjudications of review comments. In most cases, your reviewer is performing a review not only to provide you advice and guidance but also to provide recommendations to leadership such as SMC/PK, DAS(C), or ADAS(C). In order to provide those recommendations and to avoid prolonging coordination or approval timelines, the reviewer needs to clearly understand how you adjudicated their comments. Do not simply respond &ldquo;Noted&rdquo;. Label your responses as accept, partially accept, or reject. Provide revised documents when appropriate to illustrate how you adjudicated comments. For partially accepted or rejected comments, explain what actions you took and provide your rationale. When partially accepting or rejecting a comment, discuss your adjudications with your COCO and reviewer before you finalize your response. It is perfectly okay to disagree with your reviewer. However, both you and the reviewer should be prepared to represent your points of view before leadership so they can make decisions regarding coordination or approval.</p>
<p class="List4">(G) For hard copies, fasten each official document into the contract file as soon as it is received to prevent misplacement or loss of documentation. For soft copies, upload documents immediately. Use file structures and names that facilitate a quick review by someone unfamiliar with your file and move draft or old versions of documents to an archive file or simply delete them.</p>
<p class="List4">(H) Arrange file contents chronologically by date under each tab, with the most recent piece of data on top or at the beginning of an electronic list.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="List4">(I) The contracting officer conducts a preliminary review of the file before submitting it for review.&nbsp; Most elementary mistakes can be filtered out by a thorough management review.&nbsp; Such reviews decrease the staff review timeline and result in fewer substantive comments. Great care and deliberation should be exercised in documenting the file, preparing the contractual document, and reviewing the adequacy and quality of both.</p>

<p class="List2">(b) Clearance process. </p>
<p class="List2">(1) Clearance approval authority (CAA) is at the SCO or DAS(C)/ADAS(C) level. The clearance review is conducted by the assigned committee reviewer in conjunction with the pricing reviewer and program attorney (as applicable) using the process in SMC PGI 5301.602-2(c)(ii).</p>
<p class="List2">(2) CAA is the COCO or below. COCOs establish procedures for conducting clearance reviews.</p>
<p class="List2">(3) Scheduling the Clearance Briefing with SCO, DAS(C), or ADAS(C).</p>
<p class="List3">(i) CAA is the SCO. The contracting officer schedules the clearance briefing with the PK Exec after legal, committee, and pricing reviewers (as applicable) have submitted their comments to the contracting officer. The contracting officer notifies the clearance reviewer(s) of the briefing date and time.</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) CAA is the DAS(C) or ADAS(C). The contracting officer is responsible for submitting the notification of anticipated Business Clearance Session in accordance with AFFARS MP 5301.9001(i)(1)(i), paragraph (A)<em>(1)</em> or (B)<em>(1)</em>. For situational awareness, the contracting officer should copy the pricing reviewer, the committee reviewer and the COCO on the notification. Prior to submitting the Business Clearance documentation to SAF/AQC, the documentation should be reviewed in accordance with the clearance review procedures described in SMC PGI 5301.9001(b)(1). </p>
<p class="List2">(4) Clearance Briefings. For clearances to the SCO, DAS(C), or ADAS(C), contracting officers are highly encouraged to use the templates identified below. SAF/AQC updates its clearance templates periodically. When DAS(C) or ADAS(C) is the CAA, follow AFFARS MP5301.9001(i)(1)(i) to ensure that the applicable SMC template below captures all necessary content for the specific action. For clearances at or below the COCO, the CAA determines whether or not a briefing is required. If the CAA does not require a briefing, the contract file should document the clearance approval and identify the information relied upon in making the clearance decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
