filed with the GAO.  The focal point must immediately notify its
supporting legal office and the contracting activity.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">

(i)  Forward a copy of the protest to the supporting legal office.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.89in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(ii)  Provide a copy of the protest (or a redacted copy if the
protest is designated as containing protected material) to the
awardee, or if no award has been made, to all offerors who appear to
have a reasonable prospect of receiving award.  If no redacted copy
of a protected protest was received, so advise <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.af-ja.mbx.afloa-jaq-workflow@mail.mil">AFLOA/JAQ</a>

and the local attorney assisting in the protest defense. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(3)  The contracting officer must, as soon as possible, but no later
than three business days of receiving the protest, consult with the
supporting legal office to determine:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.89in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(i)  Whether corrective action should be taken.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.89in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(ii)  Whether summary dismissal should be requested.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.14in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(A)  The GAO may summarily dismiss a protest or protest ground that
on its face is untimely, fails to set forth a detailed statement of
the legal and factual grounds of protest, or involves a matter
outside of GAO s jurisdiction (<a href="http://www.gao.gov/decisions/bidpro/bid/bibreg.html">4
CFR 21.5</a>).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.14in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(B)  At the request of AFLOA/JAQ, the contracting officer must
prepare and forward documents supporting request for dismissal. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.14in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(C)  AFLOA/JAQ may authorize the contracting activity to delay
preparation of the agency report while the GAO considers a request
for dismissal.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(4)  AFLOA/JAQ will notify the contracting officer and supporting
legal office as to which documents AFLOA/JAQ requests to be forwarded
electronically in advance of the Agency Report.  AFLOA/JAQ will
direct the format in which files will be sent.  Files transmitted
electronically in advance of the agency report typically include core
documents such as Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD), Source
Selection Evaluation Board reports, and debriefing given to
protester.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(5)  The contracting officer must, within ten days after the Air
Force receives the protest, provide the draft statement of facts and
table of contents to the supporting legal office.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(6)  The contracting officer must e-mail drafts of the initial

(1)  The contracting activity must electronically transmit all copies
of the agency report so that AFLOA/JAQ receives them not later than
20 days after the Air Force is notified of the protest.  If GAO uses
the express option procedures, AFLOA/JAQ must receive the agency
report within 10 days from the date the express option is invoked. 
Only AFLOA/JAQ will distribute agency reports to the GAO and other
parties.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(2)  The GAO may request production of the agency report prior to the
deadlines described above.  The contracting activity must work with
AFLOA/JAQ to ensure that these time frames are met.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(3)  The focal point must work in concert with the contracting
activity and review the contracting officer s statement of facts
prior to its submission to <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.af-ja.mbx.afloa-jaq-workflow@mail.mil">AFLOA/JAQ</a>.
 The focal point must ensure that the contracting officer s
statement of facts is in the proper format and addresses all protest
allegations and that the agency report is otherwise complete.

<p style="margin-left: 0.3in"><font color="#000000">(e)  <i>Process
After Agency Report is Filed</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(1)  Comments on the Agency Report</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.89in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(i)  The protester and all interested parties may file written
comments on the agency report within ten days of receiving the
report. (If the protest is being decided under the express option,
the protester must file its comments with GAO within five days of
receiving the Agency Report.)  Per <a href="http://www.gao.gov/legal/bids/bibreg.html">4
CFR 21.3(i)</a>, if the protester does not file written comments
within 10 days of receiving the agency report (or 5 days under the
express option), the GAO will dismiss the protest unless the GAO
grants an extension.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.89in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(ii)  The protester may request additional documents after the agency
report has been filed if the existence or relevance of documents
first becomes evident from the agency report.  At the request of
AFLOA/JAQ, the contracting officer must provide additional documents
within two days.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.89in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(iii)  Based on the agency report and comments from the protester,
the GAO may require additional submissions from the Air Force.  When
requested, the contracting officer must provide responses directly to
<a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.af-ja.mbx.afloa-jaq-workflow@mail.mil">AFLOA/JAQ</a>
in order to ensure a timely response to the GAO.  The focal point
must be copied on any response provided to AFLOA/JAQ.  The focal
point makes comments or suggestions on supplemental responses
directly to AFLOA/JAQ or SAF/AQC.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(2)  Hearings</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.89in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(i)  The contracting activity must provide the requested witnesses
and other support required by AFLOA/JAQ.  The contracting activity is
responsible for funding witness travel and TDY costs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.89in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(ii)  At the request of the GAO through AFLOA/JAQ or at the request
of AFLOA/JAQ, the contracting activity must obtain and fund court
reporter services to transcribe the hearing.  The cost of court
reporter services is typically shared between the contracting
activity, the Protester, and the intervener. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.3in"><font color="#000000">     </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.3in"><font color="#000000">(f)  <i>Resolving</i><i>
the Protest</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(1)  GAO Decision.  If the protest goes to a written decision, the
GAO will usually issue the decision within 100 days of the filing of
the original protest.  A protest decision involving protected
information will be released to the parties under the protective
order.  A protected decision may be viewed within the government, but
may not be released to, or discussed with, non-government personnel
unless those personnel have been explicitly admitted to access of
protected material under the protective order.  Generally, those
admitted to access under the protective order will be legal counsel
for the protester and interveners.  The GAO will issue a public
redacted version of the decision at a later date. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.89in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(i)  Denial or Dismissal.  If the GAO denies or dismisses a protest,
the protest is closed. The Air Force can proceed with all contractual
actions upon notification of denial or dismissal.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.89in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(ii)  Sustain.  If the GAO sustains a protest, the GAO will also
recommend corrective action and may recommend payment of reasonable
protest costs, to include reasonable attorney fees.  In some cases
the GAO may also recommend payment of proposal preparation costs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.14in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(A)  Corrective action should be accomplished pursuant to paragraph
(g) below.   A decision not to comply with a GAO recommendation for
corrective action may only be made by SAF/AQC.  Any recommendation
not to comply with GAO s corrective action recommendation must be
coordinated with the focal point and forwarded through the SCO to
<a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-aq.mbx.saf-aqc-workflow@mail.mil">SAF/AQC</a>
and <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.af-ja.mbx.afloa-jaq-workflow@mail.mil">AFLOA/JAQ</a>
within 15 days of the date of the decision. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.14in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(B)  Potential costs may include attorney fees and in-house costs
related to pursuit of the protest.  Costs must be paid by the base or
procuring activity.  A protester must submit a cost claim to the
agency within 60 days of a decision or recommendation to award costs.
 Any cost claim received should be forwarded immediately to
<a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.af-ja.mbx.afloa-jaq-workflow@mail.mil">AFLOA/JAQ</a>.
 GAO has established a body of law around the payment of cost claims,
and AFLOA/JAQ will analyze the claim for reimbursable and unallowable
expenses.  AFLOA/JAQ, with the contracting officer s approval, may
offer a settlement to the protester, subject to the approval of the
contracting officer.  If a settlement cannot be reached, the GAO may
decide the claim in a written decision.  Once a final figure is
determined (either through settlement or by the GAO), the contracting
officer arranges for payment to the protester.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(2)  Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).  It is Air Force policy to
use ADR to the maximum extent practicable and appropriate to resolve
disputes at the earliest stage feasible, by the fastest and least
expensive method possible, and at the lowest possible organizational
level.  Outcome prediction is a form of ADR commonly used in bid
protests in which the GAO advises the parties of its likely position
if the protest were resolved in a written decision.  The viability of
outcome prediction depends on the nature of the protest (usually a
few discrete issues for which there is clearly established precedent)
and the GAO attorney assigned to the case.  Outcome prediction is not
binding on the parties, but Air Force policy is to follow the outcome
prediction recommendations.  Other nonbinding ADR procedures
(including but not limited to mediation) are available and should be
considered for use in appropriate cases.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(3)  Consultation.  When considering the use of ADR proceedings
(other than GAO outcome prediction) to resolve a bid protest, and
before initiating an ADR proceeding, the contracting officer and
AFLOA/JAQ must notify <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-gc.mbx.saf-gcr-workflow@mail.mil">SAF/GCR</a>
and <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-gc.mbx.saf-gcq-workflow@mail.mil">SAF/GCQ</a>
and work with those offices to identify an ADR procedure appropriate
to the individual case.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(4)  Settlement.  The Air Force may decide to settle a protest.  A
settlement must be a formal, written agreement signed by the
contracting officer.  A settlement must include the actions the Air
Force agrees to such as to take corrective action, pay certain
protest costs, produce selected documents, or take other
fact-specific actions.  In exchange, the protester agrees to withdraw
its protest and may waive certain cost entitlements.  Settlement of a
protest is not a  payoff  to the protester, and is only pursued
when doing so is in the best interests of the Air Force considering
cost factors and litigation risk.  If a settlement is negotiated, the
contracting officer must electronically submit a copy of the signed
settlement agreement to AFLOA/JAQ.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(5)  Withdrawal.  The protester may withdraw the protest, either
because of corrective action taken by the Air Force or for other
reasons.  Once the protester gives notice of withdrawal to the GAO
and the GAO concurs, the contracting activity can resume all
contractual actions. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.3in"><font color="#000000">(g)  <i>Corrective
Action</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(1)  Corrective action may be taken by the Air Force at any time
during the protest process or upon the recommendation of the GAO when
a protest is sustained. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(2)  Corrective action is appropriate when a significant flaw in the
procurement process has been discovered or when GAO precedent
suggests that the protest will likely be sustained.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(3)  Prompt corrective action must be taken to minimize costs to the
Air Force.  Corrective action taken prior to submission of the agency
report will usually prevent the agency from having to pay protest
costs.  In contrast, corrective action taken after submission of the
agency report will often result in the agency having to pay costs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(4)  Reporting.  Within five days of a decision to take corrective
action (either voluntary or as recommended by the GAO), the
contracting officer must provide a corrective action plan through
