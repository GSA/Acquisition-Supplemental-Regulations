<p class="western">Procedures for proceeding with an action listed in
<a href="5309.html">AFFARS 5309.103(b)(iii)</a> when the
contractor or subcontractor is listed on the CRWL.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.3in"><font color="#000000">(a) Prime
Contractors.  Review the facts surrounding the decision to place the
contractor on the CRWL (See <a href="5309.html">AFFARS
5309.105-1(a)(1)</a>) and other relevant information to determine
whether to recommend proceeding with the action.  The determination
is documented using a contracting officer s D&amp;F.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(1) If the contracting officer s determination recommends
proceeding despite the contractor being listed on the CRWL, the
contracting officer must obtain approval of the determination from
SMC/CC before proceeding with the contract action.  The contracting
officer shall coordinate the D&amp;F with the applicable COCO and SMC
2-Letter Director, SMC/JA, SMC/PI, SMC/SB (if the contractor is a
small business), and SMC/PK prior to seeking SMC/CC approval.  If
SMC/CC does not approve the D&amp;F, the contracting officer may not
proceed with the action.  If the action was a sole source contract
award, entering into discussions (or equivalent activity), or a
competitive contract award (i.e., pre-award actions), the contracting
officer must notify the contractor in writing that it has been
determined non-responsible as a result of the conditions that caused
its listing on the CRWL.  The determination of non-responsibility
must be documented in the AFFARS Contractor Responsibility template
as <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/affars_pgi_related_documents/contractor_responsibility_DandF_tailored_for_SMC.pdf">tailored
for SMC</a> (See <a href="5309.html">AFFARS 5309.105-2(a)(1)</a>).
 When the conditions in FAR 9.105-2(b)(2)(i) apply, the determination
of non-responsibility shall be documented in FAPIIS.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(2) If the action was a sole source contract award, entering into
discussions (or equivalent activity), or a competitive contract award
and the contracting officer determines not to proceed with the
action, the contracting officer shall make a determination of
non-responsibility (which does not require SMC/CC approval) and must
notify the contractor in writing that it has been determined
non-responsible as a result of the conditions that caused its listing
on the CRWL.  The determination of non-responsibility must be
documented in the AFFARS Contractor Responsibility template as

(3) When the contract action does not require the contractor to be
notified, e.g., option exercise or contract modification,
notification is permitted at the contracting officer s discretion
considering the type of action, previous interactions with the
contractor, and other relevant circumstances.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.3in"><font color="#000000">(b)
Subcontractors.  Prime contractors must obtain the contracting
officer s consent to subcontract with a company listed on the CRWL
before awarding a subcontract valued in excess of $3M or 5% of the
prime contract value, whichever is lesser.  Proposed subcontractors
must disclose to the prime contractor if they are listed on the CRWL.
 If the prime contractor requests consent to subcontract with a
contractor listed on the CRWL, review the prime contractor s
determination of subcontractor responsibility, the facts surrounding
the decision to place the proposed subcontractor on the CRWL (See
<a href="5309.html">AFFARS 5309.105-1(a)(1)</a>), and any other
relevant information to determine whether or not grant consent.  If
the contractor s request for subcontract consent is submitted with
its competitive proposal, the contracting officer s determination
whether to grant or withhold consent must be made before entering
into discussions (or equivalent activity) with the prime contractor. 
If the contractor s request for subcontract consent is submitted
post award, consider it upon receipt.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.57in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
(1) If the contracting officer recommends granting consent despite
the proposed subcontractor s listing on the CRWL, the contracting
officer must obtain approval from SMC/CC before granting consent to
subcontract.  The contracting officer shall document the
determination to grant consent on a contracting officer s D&amp;F
and shall coordinate the D&amp;F with the applicable COCO and SMC
2-Letter Director, SMC/JA, SMC/PI, SMC/SB (if the subcontractor is a
small business), and SMC/PK prior to seeking SMC/CC approval.  If
SMC/CC does not approve the D&amp;F, the contracting officer must
notify the prime contractor in writing that consent to subcontract is
withheld as a result of the conditions that led to the
subcontractor s listing on the CRWL.

at any time by submitting a written request to SMC/CC.  The request
must provide evidence that the company has addressed or resolved the
