The assignment of a COR is not necessary when the CO retains or delegates surveillance to DCMA, or one of the categories of services exempted in AFI 63-138.</p>
<p><strong>1.0 Contracting Officer Roles and Responsibilities<p id="docid_1"></p></strong></p>
<p>1.1 As part of the acquisition planning process, the CO must determine the nature of the work/requirement (Type A, B, or C) as specified in <a href="http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/500072p.pdf">DoDI 5000.72</a>, <em>DoD Standard for Contracting Officer s Representative (COR) Certification</em>.</p>
<p>1.2 If the requiring activity has not yet initiated a COR nomination, the CO must initiate the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/templates/request_for_COR_support.pdf">Request for COR Support</a> to notify the requiring activity of the need for COR(s) support and to prompt requiring activity nomination of a qualified COR via the Joint Appointment Module (JAM) (formerly CORT Tool) in Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE).</p>
