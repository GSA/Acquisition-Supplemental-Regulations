<p><strong>Mandatory Procedure <p id="docid_0"></p></strong></p>

<p><strong>MP5305.303<br>
Announcement of Contract Awards<p id="docid_1"></p></strong></p>

<p><em>[2019 Edition]</em>The following mandatory procedure is provided for preparing 1279 Reports under DFARS 205.303 and Reports of Intent to Award multiyear contracts under <a href="5317.htm#p5317170">AFFARS 5317.170</a>.</p>
<p>(a)(i) The 1279 Report is used for Congressional notification and public announcement of contract awards and other transactions that exceed the DoD threshold. Use the 1279 Report Format in (d), tailored where appropriate, when preparing Reports of Intent to Award IAW<a href="C:%5CUsers%5C1022881279C.AREA52%5CDesktop%5CAFAC%202019-1001%5C5317.htm#p5317170">AFFARS 5317.170</a>. It is important to note that the Notice of Intent to Award IAW <a href="C:%5CUsers%5C1022881279C.AREA52%5CDesktop%5CAFAC%202019-1001%5C5317.htm#p5317170">AFFARS 5317.170</a> does not satisfy the requirement for a 1279 Report.</p>
<p>(ii) Alternate 1279 reporting for the announcement of source selection contract awards. If the awardee information cannot be provided three days in advance, the report does not need to identify the offeror that has been selected for award. Insert  Source Selection Information - Will Advise  for  Contractor Data  and either "$50 million or above" or "below $50 million" for  Face Value  and  Funding Data . When using these procedures, provide the successful offeror, face value of the award, and funding data to <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-ll.mbx.saf-llp-contract-ancmt@mail.mil">SAF/LLP</a> no later than 1300 hours Eastern the day before the anticipated award date. If SAF/LLP is not notified by 1300 hours Eastern the day before the anticipated award date, announcement of the award may need to be delayed.</p>
<p>(b) After a 1279 Report has been submitted, report any changes in plans promptly to <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-ll.mbx.saf-llp-contract-ancmt@mail.mil">SAF/LLP</a>.</p>
<p>(c) When immediate award is required and advance notification under paragraph (a) above was not accomplished, prepare the 1279 Report as usual and send it to <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-ll.mbx.saf-llp-contract-ancmt@mail.mil">SAF/LLP</a>. Include the justification for immediate award. If the Congressional and public announcement cannot be made the same day as the award, the contracting officer must obtain the contractor s agreement to withhold public announcement of the award until the award is posted on <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts/">https://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts/</a>. Include in the report a statement that this non-disclosure agreement has been made. The contracting officer will notify the contractor of the agreed upon date of public announcement. The award may then be made without the three-day coordination.</p>
<p>(d) Format (do not include classified information in the report):</p>
<p>(1) Format the SUBJECT line of the email as follows:</p>
<p>FOUO: Release Date is DD MMM YY, Program Name, Contracting Activity, DD-LA-(AR) 1279 Report</p>
