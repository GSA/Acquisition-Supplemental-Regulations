<p>(a) FAR 9.105-1 outlines various methods of obtaining information to help the contracting officer in determining responsibility.  When additional information is needed, a questionnaire can be developed to ask the contractor for the information needed.  <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/affars_pgi_related_documents/contractor_responsibility_sample_questions.docx"><span class="underline">Sample questions</span></a> may be applicable and included in the questionnaire prepared for submittal to the contractor.  Questionnaire results should be included as substantiating material with the contracting officer s determination of responsibility or non-responsibility.</p>
<p><span id="smc_105_2" class="anchor"></span></p>
<p><strong>SMC PGI 5309.105-2 Determinations and Documentation</strong></p>
<p>(a)(1)(i) A responsibility or non-responsibility D&F is required only for those actions that are pre-award actions. Responsibility is a consideration only for prospective contractors, and is determined only pre-award. Considerations made to inform whether to take certain post-award actions, such as exercising an option or a contract modification resulting from an ECP, are part of contract administration business decisions. Many of the factors that are considered in determining responsibility pre-award and in making business decisions post-award are similar, e.g. ability to perform the work required by the contract action, being qualified and eligible under applicable laws, and having a satisfactory record of business ethics and no felony convictions or civil judgements, but responsibility is applied only pre-award.</p>
<p>(ii) A contracting officer's D&F is required to make a recommendation to SMC/CC, regarding CRWL related actions, regardless of whether the action is pre- or post- award or is independent of a specific contracting action. The following table depicts which type of D&F is required, by type of action, when following the CRWL procedures for when a company is on the CRWL or is being added to the CRWL.</p>

<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> The contracting officer's D&F should have been approved by SMC/CC prior to issuance of the solicitation; therefore, a new D&F is not required for award. However, if the contractor was not listed on the CRWL until sometime after solicitation release, the contracting officer will prepare a contracting officer's D&F for SMC/CC approval before proceeding to contract award.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> The contracting officer's D&F should have been approved by SMC/CC prior to entering into discussions (or equivalent activity); therefore, a new D&F is not required for award. However, if discussions (or equivalent activity) did not occur or the offeror was listed on the CRWL sometime after entering into discussions (or equivalent activity), the contracting officer will prepare a contracting officer's D&F for SMC/CC approval before proceeding to contract award.</p>

<p><strong>SMC PGI 5309.503 Waiver</strong></p>
<p>If the contracting officer determines that it is not possible to adequately mitigate or avoid an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) but it is in the best interest of the Government to award the contract notwithstanding the conflict of interest, the contracting officer will request a waiver, in writing, from the HCA in accordance with FAR 9.503 and AFFARS 5309.503.  The waiver request package should include: (1) the waiver request, including a description of the extent of the conflict and an analysis of why application of the requirement requested to be waived would not be in the Government s best interest in the particular situation, (2) the contracting officer s approved OCI determination and findings (D&F) with detailed analysis, including an assessment of the risk to current and future related acquisitions and the probability of the OCI s occurrence, and (3) the contractor s OCI mitigation plan (if applicable). </p>
