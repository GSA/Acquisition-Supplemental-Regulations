<p>* For the Air Force, in accordance with FAR 2.101, procuring activity is synonymous with contracting activity.</p>
<p>**J&amp;As for actions exceeding $93M must be coordinated with the DAS(C) or the ADAS(C) and approved by the SPE). The contracting officer must submit justifications requiring approval by the SPE simultaneously to <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-aq.mbx.saf-aq-workflow@mail.mil">SAF/AQ</a> and to <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-aq.mbx.saf-aqc-workflow@mail.mil">SAF/AQC</a> after coordination by the SCO. Allow 18 days for staffing and SPE approval after receipt by <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-aq.mbx.saf-aq-workflow@mail.mil">SAF/AQ</a>. J&amp;A packages submitted to SAF/AQ shall include an electronic Staff Summary Sheet (<a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/Documents/eSSS.docx">eSSS</a>) in the body of the email or as an attachment (Word document only). Include the approved acquisition strategy (or a draft acquisition strategy if the strategy document has not been approved) with the J&amp;A package, and list each attachment under  Tabs  on the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/Documents/eSSS.docx">eSSS</a> using the exact electronic file name (e.g., ACE Acquisition Strategy) of the corresponding attachment. If a J&amp;A supports an indefinite-delivery type contract, see <a href="5316.htm#p5316504c1iiD">AFFARS 5316.504(c)(1)(ii)(D)</a> for processing instructions. The SCO may authorize solicitation release after the justification is reviewed for adequacy and forwarded to <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-aq.mbx.saf-aq-workflow@mail.mil">SAF/AQ</a> and <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-aq.mbx.saf-aqc-workflow@mail.mil">SAF/AQC</a>. Submit questions or concerns regarding processing a J&amp;A for SPE approval to <a href="mailto:usaf.pentagon.saf-aq.mbx.saf-aqc-workflow@mail.mil">SAF/AQC</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(4) Changes recommended during the staffing process must be adjudicated by the contracting officer in coordination with SAF/AQC prior to submitting the J&amp;A to the SPE for approval.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(e) <span class="underline">Prior to contract award:</span> After a J&amp;A has been approved, but prior to contract award, if the dollar value of the contract is expected to exceed the original J&amp;A approval authority, the contracting officer must submit an amended J&amp;A to the appropriate approving authority for approval. The amended J&amp;A shall identify the dollar increase from the initial, approved J&amp;A.</p>
<p>(f) <span class="underline">After contract award:</span> When a proposed contract action is for new work outside the scope of the original contract, the contracting officer must submit a new J&amp;A as a stand-alone document to the appropriate approving authority based on the dollar value of the contract action for the new work. New work should not commence until the new J&amp;A is approved unless authorized in accordance with FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency. See <a href="5343.htm">5343.102-90</a> regarding contract scope considerations.</p>
<p>(g) A new J&amp;A is not required for:</p>
<p>(1) a decrease in the dollar value or scope of the effort; or</p>
<p>(2) an increase in the estimated dollar value of in-scope work, except as described in (e) above.</p>
