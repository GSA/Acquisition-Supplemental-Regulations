<p>(b)(3) Acquisitions less than $10M that should consider use of an AP rather than a SASS:</p>
<p>(i) Acquisitions where there is limited experience with the specified requirement and there is a moderate to high risk of not completing the acquisition successfully;</p>
<p>(ii) Acquisitions where incentives (e.g. award fee, incentive fee) are to be included;</p>
<p>(iii) Acquisitions where there is a history of protests or performance problems; and,</p>
<p>(iv) Acquisitions being conducted in accordance with FAR 15.3 and DoD Source Selection</p>
<p>Procedures unless the Source Selection Authority (SSA) is the contracting officer.</p>
<p>(b)(4) The acquisition strategy approving authority may utilize the ASP briefing charts and associated note pages, minutes, and changed charts to satisfy a required written AP if the content complies with requirements set forth in DFARS PGI 207.105</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(a) In order to develop a sound acquisition strategy acquisition teams should engage with the AFICC/KA Acquisition Center of Excellence (ACE) and others as appropriate, including Contracting, Financial Management, Staff Judge Advocate and other technical experts (e.g., <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10263/projects/services/SitePages/PEOCM.aspx">AFPEO/CM</a>).</p>
<p>(b) In order to maximize mission effectiveness through reductions in rate, process and demand management, Contracting Officers are encouraged to identify and consider the use of existing contracts and agreements, to include those within the Department of Defense and Federal Agencies, during the market research phase and prior to awarding a new contract.  At a minimum, Contracting Officers should consider exploring the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10074/afcc/AFICC/KA/SitePages/sslp.aspx">AFICC Launch Pad</a> and <a href="https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov/app/#/solutionsfinder">GSA Acquisition Gateway (Solution Finder)</a> and also utilize available resources such as the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10074/afcc/AFICC/KA/sst/default.aspx">AFICC Strategic Sourcing Toolbox</a>.</p>

<p><strong>AFMC PGI 5307.104 General Procedures</strong></p>
<p>(a) In order to develop a sound acquisition strategy, AFMC acquisition personnel are encouraged to engage the local Acquisition Center of Excellence (ACE) and others as appropriate, including Contracting, Financial Management, Staff Judge Advocate, Small Business and other technical experts.</p>
<p>(b) AFMC/CA is the Early Strategy & Issues Session (ESIS) authority for AFPEO/CM acquisitions <span class="underline">></span> $100M to &lt;$1B unless further delegated by AFMC/CA. See the AFPEO/CM ESIS template. To schedule an ESIS for programs where AFMC/CA is the approval authority, send an email notification to AFMC/PK Workflow with the following information: name of program, program office POC, estimated dollar value, projected need date for the ESIS, status of RAD, projected ASP date, RFP release date, and contract award date.</p>

<p><strong>AFMC PGI 5307.104-92 Acquisition Strategy Panels (ASP) and Acquisition Plan (AP) Approval Authority or Streamlined Acquisition Strategy Summary (SASS) Approval Authority</strong></p>
<p>(a)(3)</p>
<p>(i) AFMC/CA is the ASP Chair for AFPEO/CM programs ≥ $100M to &lt; $1B, unless further <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10148/afcc/contracting_services_reports/afmc%20services%20management%20agreement%20and%20delegations/forms/allitems.aspx">delegated</a> by AFMC/CA. To schedule an ASP for programs where AFMC/CA is the approval authority, send an e-mail notification to AFMC/PK Workflow with the following information: name of program, program office POC, date of ESIS, status of RAD, projected RFP release date and contract award date.</p>
<p>(b)(1)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) AFMC/CA is the AP approval authority for AFPEO/CM programs ≥ $100M to &lt; $1B, unless further <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10148/afcc/contracting_services_reports/afmc%20services%20management%20agreement%20and%20delegations/forms/allitems.aspx">delegated</a> by AFMC/CA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(b)(2) The following actions do not require an AP or SASS:</p>
<ol start="6" type="a">
<li><p>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, including the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program (e.g., DoD-wide program planning/solicitation)</p></li>
<li><p>Acquisitions in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5. Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For Air Force Research Laboratory:</p>
<p>(a)(5) In order to provide a consistent approach within AFRL, the following procedures for the use of combined ASP/APs are encouraged:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>While the ASP/AP will describe the development program (see DFARS 207.103(d)(i) and FAR 32.7), the approval authority should be based upon the total value of contracts to be issued except under Open BAAs, wherein approval authority is based on the highest dollar value for which contracts can be awarded.</p></li>
<li><p>For R&D actions above the thresholds in DFARS 207.103(d)(i) see the AFRL <a href="https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/AFP40/d/s6925EC13538A0FB5E044080020E329A9/Files/PKunique/PKPolicyVault/ASPTemplate%20FinalR1.pptx">ASP/AP Template</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) with calls. This approach allows for publication of a basic BAA solicitation that contains overarching information, but does not request white papers or full proposals. The requests for white papers and/or proposals are transmitted via Calls. The ASP/AP briefing presented to the approval authority should be based upon the total estimated value of awards to be made under the BAA with Calls. The ASP/AP briefing should specifically address any follow-on strategy planning requirements applicable before issuing individual calls and the approval authority for the call strategy. Contracting should coordinate on the proposed approach to follow-on strategy requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Open BAAs. This approach allows offerors to submit proposals any time during the open period. Because it specifically requests proposal submittal, it should be considered a solicitation. An ASP/AP should be accomplished before the open BAA is issued. The approval authority for the ASP/AP should be based on the highest dollar value for which contracts can be awarded.</p></li>
<li><p>Revisions to ASP/APs. In order to ensure consistency, a significant change affecting the acquisition is one that meets any of the following criteria:</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>The need to issue a new contract that was not anticipated in the approved ASP/AP for a development program or the need to process a Justification and Approval for a modification to a contract.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Change in contract type for an anticipated contract.</p></li>
<li><p>The cumulative value of the anticipated basic contract(s) and all modifications is/are expected to exceed the approval threshold of the previous ASP/AP approval authority.</p></li>
<li><p>The cumulative value of all modifications is greater than or equal to 100 percent of the value of the anticipated basic contract(s).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>AFRLI 61-201 procedures to approve and disapprove work unit baseline changes do not change or modify any contracting procedures related to the need for an updated ASP/AP as described above.</p></li>
</ol>
