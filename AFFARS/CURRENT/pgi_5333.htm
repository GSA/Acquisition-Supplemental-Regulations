<p><strong>AFICC PGI 5333.102-90 General</strong></p>
<p>This PGI establishes the AFICC standardized process for protests. <a href="mailto:afica.kp.workflow@us.af.mil">AFICC/KP</a> is the focal point for protests for operational contracting units for which AFICC provides contracting authority.</p>
<p>(a) Each AFICC OL SCO and/or ESS/KD Commander/Director should appoint and provide their designated primary and alternate protest focal point contact information (primary/alternate, full name, DSN, and email address) to AFICC via the <a href="mailto:afica.kp.workflow@us.af.mil">AFICC/KP workflow</a>. AFICC OL Policy Leads, ESS Superintendents (if applicable) and specifically designated primary and alternate protest focal points will also be given restricted access permissions to the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10074/afcc/aficc/kp/Reporting_Main/reporting_protests.aspx">AFICC Protest Reporting Tool.</a> Restricted access to the SharePoint site is limited to a few individuals from each AFICC OL, ESS/KD and to AFICC staff.</p>
<p>(1) Promptly notify AFICC via the <a href="mailto:afica.kp.workflow@us.af.mil">AFICC/KP workflow</a> when a designated focal point is no longer designated so that permissions to the restricted access site can be removed accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) Advise each of their AFICC operational contracting units of who their AFICC OL Director, AFICC Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS), and AFICC/KD designated protest focal points are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) Each Specialized/Operational Contracting Unit (ESS, SCONS, CONS, CONF, etc.) should ensure their respective AFICC OL and/or ESS/KD designated protest focal points are apprised of the status of protests and protest resolutions to include such information as the disposition (denied or sustained), protest withdrawn, corrective action(s) taken, decisions, etc. If not already provided directly to the designated AFICC OL and/or ESS/KD protest focal point, the contracting officer should immediately submit required information and documents (copy of protest and decision/adjudication, once finalized) to the focal points for upload into the AFICC Protest Reporting Tool.</p>
<p>(ii) Once a protest has been filed with a protest venue (Agency, Government Accountability Office (GAO) or U.S. Court of Federal Claims (COFC), designated AFICC OL and/or ESS/KD protest focal points should notify their leadership and affected personnel of protests, as deemed appropriate. This varies by individual MAJCOM, Center, Wing, etc.</p>
<p>(iii) Within three (3) work days of the date the protest was filed with the applicable protest venue (Agency, GAO, or U.S. COFC), complete the fillable reporting tool form and upload/submit a copy of the actual protest, as Adobe PDF document or emails with attachments as an Outlook.msg file into the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10074/afcc/afica/kp/Reporting_Main/reporting_protests.aspx">AFICC</a> <a href="hhttps://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10074/afcc/aficc/kp/Reporting_Main/reporting_protests.aspx">Protest Reporting Tool.</a> This should automatically generate an email alert notification to both the <a href="mailto:afica.kp.workflow@us.af.mil">AFICC/KP workflow</a> and to the <a href="mailto:esg.ds.aficaexec@us.af.mil">AFICC Exec Workflow box</a>.</p>

<p><strong>AFICC PGI 5333.103 Protests to the Agency</strong></p>
<p>(f) Contracting officers are encouraged to work with interested parties to resolve issues amicably in lieu of a protest.
