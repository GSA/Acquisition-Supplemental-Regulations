<p><strong>MP5301.603-90</strong></p>
<p><strong>Selection, Appointment, and Termination of Appointment of Contracting Officers</strong></p>
<p><strong>2019 Edition</strong></p>
<p><em>Revised: 2 May 2022</em></p>
<p class="List1"><strong>Back to Basics (BtB):</strong> Due to changes in the DoD certification program, some candidates may be unable to complete certification. An individual without certification may be selected for contracting officer appointment (limited or unlimited) if approved by the warrant issuing authority (SCO/COCO.) </p>
<ol><li>
<em>Applicability</em>. This MP must be used when selecting, nominating, appointing, and terminating contracting officers (CO) to maximize standardization across the AF. Warrants are issued in accordance with <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-1#FAR_1_603">FAR 1.603</a>, <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-201-federal-acquisition-regulations-system#DFARS-201.603">DFARS 201.603</a>, 10 USC 1724 and this MP. The SCO may delegate this authority to the highest contracting official in the contracting chain at geographically separated organizations, but in no event will the designee be lower than a GS-15 (or equivalent) or O-6. Authority to issue limited contracting officer warrants of less than $5M and authority to terminate appointments of less than $5M may be delegated, but in no event will the designee be lower than the COCO. </li>
</ol><ol><li>
<em>Warranting</em>. An individual selected for contracting officer appointment must be a military member in Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 64PX or 6C0X1 or a civilian in the GS-1102 occupational series who occupies a manned authorization listed under these specialty codes/series, and complies with the requirements at <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-201-federal-acquisition-regulations-system#DFARS-201.603-2">DFARS 201.603-2</a> and this MP.</li>
  <li>
<em>Focal Point (FP).</em> FPs must be designated in writing via the FP designation form and may be assigned unlimited or limited duties as indicated in the <a href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/KnowledgeCenter/contracting_templates/warrant_process_focal_point_designation.pdf"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>Warrant Process Focal Point Designation Form</em></span></a><a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10148/AFCC/afmc_pk_mp_ig/Templates/warrant_process_focal_point_designation.pdf">.</a> </li>
</ol><p>Each SCO is responsible for appointing FPs and must designate at least one FP with unlimited duties. </p>
<p>SCOs may delegate authority to appoint &ldquo;limited FPs&rdquo; to perform Contracting Officer Test (COT) Proctor functions to the COCO. This authority is not further delegable. Follow the form instructions when appointing FPs. </p>

<ol><li>
<em>AF CO Warrant Tracking Tool</em>. All warrants are entered into and tracked via the AF CO Warrant Tracking Tool <a href="https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/PK-Central/AFCC/afmc_pk_mp_ig/Warrant/SitePages/Warrant-Home.aspx">(</a><a href="https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/PK-Central/AFCC/afmc_pk_mp_ig/Warrant/SitePages/Warrant-Home.aspx"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>AFCOWTT</em></span></a><a href="https://usaf.dps.mil/teams/PK-Central/AFCC/afmc_pk_mp_ig/Warrant/SitePages/Warrant-Home.aspx">)</a>. FPs obtain access to the AFCOWTT by submitting a copy of the Warrant Process Focal Point Designation Form<span style="color:#0000FF !important"> </span>to <a href="mailto:afmc.pk.workflow-02@us.af.mil">HQ AFMC/PK</a>. Prior to obtaining access, FPs must request training on the use of the AFCOWTT by contacting HQ AFMC/PK, as applicable. FPs are responsible for entering all warrant data into the tool, and for uploading warrants <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/certificate-appointment">(</a><a href="https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/certificate-appointment"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>SF1402s</em></span></a><a href="https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/certificate-appointment">)</a> (and up to three past SF1402s), a copy of the COT certificate, and the<a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/templates/co_appointment_warrant__transfer_termination_request.pdf"> </a><a href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/KnowledgeCenter/contracting_templates/co_appointment_warrant__transfer_termination_request.pdf">Contracting Officer Appointment/Warrant Eligibility Transfer/Termination Request (COWER)</a>. FPs also administer all other warrant actions and are responsible for maintaining current, accurate, and complete warrant data in the AFCOWTT. </li>
</ol><ol><li>
<em>CO Warrant Nomenclature</em>. All transferable warrants shall list &ldquo;Department of the Air Force&rdquo; on the &lsquo;Organization&rsquo; and &lsquo;Agency/Department&rsquo; lines of the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/certificate-appointment"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>SF1402</em></span></a>. All transferable warrants are numbered as follows: the first two positions are &ldquo;AF&rdquo;, the third and fourth positions are the last two digits of the fiscal year (FY) in which the appointment is made, and positions 5-9 are obtained from the identification (ID) field of the AFCOWTT; for example, in FY21 an ID field number of 12345 would yield an appointment number of AF-21-12345. Current transferable warrants will be updated through attrition. All new non-transferable warrants will be numbered as follows: Organization-FY-XXXXX e.g., SSC-21-12499 for SSC; positions 5-9 are obtained from the ID field of the AFCOWTT. </li>
</ol><ol><li>
<em>Nominating Warrant Candidates</em>.<strong>  </strong>Warrant candidates are nominated by a candidate sponsor who shall be no lower than the candidate&rsquo;s first level supervisor. Submit warrant nominations to the designated FP using the COWER. </li>
  <li>
<em>AF Contracting Officer Test (COT).</em><strong>  </strong>Candidates for warrants above the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) must pass the two-hour timed, open book COT by achieving a minimum score of 80%.</li>
  <li>The COT is a proctored, computer generated test containing 25 randomly selected true/false and multiple-choice questions from the FAR, DFARS, and/or AFFARS. Each question is worth up to two points. </li>
  <li>During the COT, candidates are limited to the use of electronic regulations available via <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/">www.acquisition.gov</a> and hard copies of the FAR and DFARS (free of tabs and notes); however, hard copies will not be provided. Notes and electronic devices are not permitted in the testing site. Use of email, instant messaging, or any other form of electronic communication is prohibited during the COT. </li>
</ol><ol><li>Candidates must provide the correct answer and the correct, associated complete reference (e.g., <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-15#FAR_15_401">FAR 15.401(a)(2)(i)(B)</a>), in order to earn two points. If the candidate answers the question correctly but provides an incorrect reference, one point will be received. If the candidate answers the question incorrectly but the reference correctly, the candidate will not receive any points as this indicates a failure to understand the regulation. The COT is automatically and electronically scored. <ul><li>
        <ol><li>If the candidate fails to pass the COT, the candidate may challenge missed questions and/or references in accordance with the <a href="https://usaf.dps.mil/:w:/r/teams/PK-Central/AFCC/records_contract/COT/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B85F2B6EF-8D77-45FB-9457-85996E91F63B%7D&amp;file=Focal Point and Proctor Guide 18 Jan 21.docx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true">Proctor User Guide</a><a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10148/AFCC/records_contract/COT/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/Proctor Area  Test Files/Forms/AllItems.aspx"> </a>only when approval of the challenge would result in a passing score. (NOTE: Access to the guide is <em>restricted</em> to warrant focal points.)</li>
          <li> A candidate who fails the COT may retake it if authorized by their immediate supervisor and space is available. If the candidate fails to pass the COT on the second attempt, the candidate may not retake the COT until a six month waiting period has passed.</li>
          <li> Supervisors are authorized to approve a maximum of two continuous learning points per 12 month period for an individual who completes the COT, whether for a warrant request action or for training purposes. </li>
        </ol></li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Practice COT: A practice test titled Contracting Officer Demo Test - C10979 was developed to help familiarize warrant candidates with the question structure of the COT. The practice test is available via the <a href="https://lms-jets.cce.af.mil/moodle/">myLearning</a> site. It is a non-proctored, 50-minute, timed test consisting of ten questions which are electronically and randomly selected from a 20 question pool. Practice tests may not be administered on the SCORM site. There is no limit on the number of times the practice COT may be taken. The completion of a practice test shall not be used as the basis for warrant eligibility. </li>
  <li>
<em>Unlimited Warrants</em>.<strong>  </strong>Warrants greater than $25M require&nbsp;a minimum of two years of contracting experience, a baccalaureate degree, successful completion of&nbsp;the Contracting Officer Test (COT)&nbsp;and passing&nbsp;a warrant board.

        <ol><li>Warrant boards are reserved exclusively for warrants greater than $25M and are used to further assess the candidate&rsquo;s experience, qualifications, communication skills, and overall demeanor. </li>
        </ol></li>
    </ul></li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul><li>

        </ol></li>
    </ul></li>
</ul><ol><li>
<em>Limited Transferable Warrants</em>.<strong>  </strong> Warrants limited by a monetary threshold are transferable across the AF. Dollarized warrant limitations apply to the value of the instant contract action a CO is executing. For example, if a CO holds a limited warrant of $5M and the contract award amount of the instant action is $6M, the CO is not authorized to sign the contract; however, the same CO would be authorized to sign a $5M funding action issued against the same contract. </li>
</ol><ul><li>

</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul><li>

</li>
  <li>
<em>Non-Transferable Warrants</em>.<strong> </strong>Non-transferable warrants may be issued for specific functions or buying activities (e.g., contract closeout, defective pricing actions, funding modifications, administrative modifications, specific contracts, units, etc.) Candidates for limited non-transferable warrants above the SAT should pass the COT in accordance with this MP. Warrant boards shall not be used for non-transferable warrants; however vetting process may be used when the resultant contract actions are expected to exceed $25M. The SF1402 must clearly state &ldquo;Limited Non-Transferable Warrant&rdquo; and cite the specific warrant limitations,</li>
  <li>
<em>Warrant Transfer and Reinstatement.</em>
    <ol><li>Warrants issued in accordance with this MP, with the exception of those issued in accordance with paragraph (l) above, are transferable across the AF. As long as a warrant is in good standing, an individual shall not be required to test or board again. However, warrant transferability does not guarantee immediate utilization, as the gaining appointing official may determine that time is needed to facilitate familiarity with new workload responsibilities and organizational procedures. Instructions regarding electronically transferring a warrant to a new organization are located in the AFCOWTT.</li>
      <li>Warrant reinstatement is applicable to an individual who previously held an AF warrant and whose warrant was subsequently terminated for reasons such as reassignment or resignation.

</ol><p> transferable or limited transferable warrants must meet the requirements of this MP to obtain a transferable and/or higher dollar value warrant. Taking of the COT is only required for those candidates holding a limited non-transferable warrant. </p>
<ol><li>
<em>Warrants Issued Based on External Warrant Credentials</em>. <strong> </strong>A new AF 1102 with external, federal government CO experience may be issued an AF warrant without meeting the requirements of this MP (COT and vetting process or warrant board) based on the discretion of the appointing official, provided they meet the qualification requirements at <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-201-federal-acquisition-regulations-system#201.603-2"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>DFARS </em></span></a><a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-201-federal-acquisition-regulations-system#201.603-2"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>201.603</em></span></a><a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-201-federal-acquisition-regulations-system#201.603-2"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>-</em></span></a><a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-201-federal-acquisition-regulations-system#201.603-2"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>2</em></span></a><a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/part-201-federal-acquisition-regulations-system#201.603-2">.</a> The appointing official must conduct an assessment of the candidate&rsquo;s qualifications and experience prior to the issuance of an AF warrant.

</ol><ol><li>
<em>Warrant Suspension or Termination for Cause</em>. Warrants may be suspended or terminated for unsatisfactory performance. The appointing official may suspend a warrant in writing until proficiency is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the appointing official.
