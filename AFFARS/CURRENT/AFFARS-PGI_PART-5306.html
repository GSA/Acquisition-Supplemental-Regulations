<h4 class="Heading4">SMC PGI 5306.301-90 Policy&nbsp;</h4>
<p class="List1">(a) Regulatory requirements to justify the use of other than full and open competition are outlined in several parts of the FAR as follows:</p>
<p class="List2">(1) 6.302 identifies the statutory authorities for contracting without full and open competition for all actions not covered by Parts 8, 13 and 16. Refer to 5306.303-2 for the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/templates/justification_and_approval_document.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>Justification and Approval Documentation template</em></span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare the J&amp;A in accordance with the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/Pages/5306.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>Preparation Guide for Other Than Full and Open Competition Justification and Approval</em></span></a> at the back of the template. (NOTE: the determination and findings (D&amp;F) required under FAR 6.202, Full and Open Competition After Exclusion of Sources, is filed under Tab 8.) (See &#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;<a href="https://insidesmc.losangeles.af.mil/sites/pk/Style Library/PON/modules/02-JandAs/default.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>Supporting Your Justification and Approval Point of Need Training</em></span>)<span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>&#8203;</em></span></a></p>

Refer to 5308.405-6(d) for the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/templates/limited_sources_J_and_A.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>Limited Sources Justification and Approval Documentation template</em></span></a>. Prepare the LSJ in accordance with the instructions in the template. </p>
<p class="List2">(3) 13.501 addresses sole source acquisitions for small dollar thresholds.</p>
<p class="List2">(4) 16.505(b)(2) addresses exceptions to fair opportunity for orders (EFO) under multiple award contracts. Refer to 5316.505(b)(2) for the <a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/templates/fair_opportunity_exception_justification.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0000FF !important"><em>Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity template</em></span></a>. Prepare the EFO in accordance with the instructions in the template.</p>
<p class="List1">(b) Submit the J&amp;A, LSJ, or EFO package to SMC/PKC as early as possible but prior to acquisition strategy approval. Contracting officers should consider reviewing the template instructions and going over an outline of the sole or limited source rationale with the SMC/PKC Reviewer prior to drafting the document. </p>
<p class="List1">(c) Each FAR part has specific posting instructions for general publication of the justification document. Ensure you understand the posting requirements of your justification document. </p>
<p class="List1">(d) When reviewing a J&amp;A, LSJ, or EFO, contracting officers should consider whether an amendment to the original Acquisition Plan is also required. If the effort is out of scope of the contract, it may also be outside the approved acquisition authority. </p>
<p class="List1">(e) For tracking and reporting purposes obtain a Local Identification Number from SMC/PKC for each J&amp;A prior to coordination.<a id="_SMC_PGI_5306.302-2"></a></p>
<h4 class="Heading4">SMC PGI 5306.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency</h4>
<p class="List1">(c)(1) Contracting officers notify the SMC/PKC Committee Reviewer and the SMC Competition Advocate if contract award is anticipated before the Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) is signed by the approving official. <a id="_SMC_PGI_5306.304"></a></p>
