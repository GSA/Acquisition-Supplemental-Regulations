<p><strong>SMC PGI 5335.017-3  Using an FFRDC </strong></p>
<p>(c) When considering whether to allow an FFRDC to participate in an acquisition as a subcontractor:</p>
<p>  (1) The contracting officer should consider whether or not the proposed arrangement complies with FAR 35.017-1 and the DoDI 5000.77 Federally Funded Research and Development (FFRDC) Program.</p>
<p>  (2) The contracting officer should ensure that the FFRDC s Sponsoring Agency has reviewed and approved the FFRDC s participation in the effort.</p>
<p>(3) The contracting officer, in collaboration with the Sponsoring Agency, should ensure that the FFRDC participation in the activity will not negatively impact the work of the FFRDC, does not pose a real or perceived conflict of interest, and is in full consonance with the policies of the sponsor and DoD policies governing technology transfer.</p>
<p>  (4) The subcontract proposal provided by the FFRDC should be of a unique nature and, in order to ensure fairness, should be made available to all competitors in a source selection.</p>
