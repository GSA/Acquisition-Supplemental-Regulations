<p class="List1">(b) In the case of inter-command acquisitions, compliance with the Buy American Statute and Balance of Payments evaluation procedures (DFARS 225.5) is the responsibility of the contracting command, except when the requiring command specifies a foreign end product, in which case, the determination is the responsibility of the requiring command.</p>
