<p class="NormalWeb"><strong><span style="color:#000000 !important">(h)(4)(90)   Pre-contract Costs</span></strong></p>
<p class="List1">(a) Pre-contract cost agreements should be reviewed for legal sufficiency (see AFMC PGI 5331.109(h)(4)(90)(b) for a sample Pre-contract Cost Agreement). As a condition precedent to the use of a pre-contract cost agreement, the correct type of funds should be available upon issuance of the pre-contract cost agreement. While not legally necessary, prudent business acumen would dictate, that to the maximum extent possible, agreement on terms and conditions also be established prior to issuance of a pre-contract cost agreement. Contracting officers should consult with the designated clearance approval authority prior to agreement on pre-contract costs. The contracting officer should incorporate the pre-contract cost agreement into any resultant contract as an attachment within Section J.</p>
<p class="List1">(b) The pre-contract cost agreement may be written as follows and should include the following minimum essential content:</p>
<p><em>Subject to approval as required by law and regulation, the undersigned agree to include a clause in any contract resulting from negotiations with (<em>insert company name</em>) under (<em>insert solicitation number</em>) that all costs not in excess of $(<em>insert dollar amount</em>) incurred by the prospective contractor after (<em>insert date</em>), and before the contract effective date, shall be recognized the same as if incurred after the effective date of the resulting contract.</em></p>
<p><em>The parties agree that the Government shall not accept any benefit of the prospective contractor&rsquo;s efforts, give no direction or encouragement, and make no payments until a contract is awarded.  If no contract results from these negotiations, the prospective contractor is responsible for any incurred costs.  Any incurred costs shall not be used as the basis of a claim against, or construed as an obligation of the Government.  (<em>Include any specific cost categories and any other limiting details</em>).</em></p>
