<p class="List1">(a) The following statement must be included in any such solicitation: <em>&ldquo;Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s): Funds are not presently available for this effort.

In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p class="List1">(b) When the resulting contract is to be funded by Procurement or Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation appropriations, the program/requirement must be included in the President&rsquo;s budget as submitted to Congress, and the program manager must provide the contracting officer a written statement. The statement must be coordinated with FM at the Center level (or equivalent) or as delegated to FM Organizational Senior Functional (OSF) that these investment funds will be used for the proposed acquisition and, although not presently available, a reasonable expectation exists that funding will be authorized and available upon enactment of the Authorization and Appropriations Acts. </p>
