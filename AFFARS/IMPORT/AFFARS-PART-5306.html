<p class="NormalWeb">**J&amp;As for actions exceeding $100M must be coordinated with the DAS(C) or the ADAS(C) and approved by the SPE.

<p class="List1">(e) <em>Prior to contract award:</em> After a J&amp;A has been approved, but prior to contract award, if new work is to be added or the dollar value of the contract is expected to exceed the original J&amp;A approval authority, the contracting officer must submit an amended J&amp;A to the appropriate approving authority for approval. The amended J&amp;A must identify the new work and/or dollar increase from the initial, approved J&amp;A.</p>
<p class="List1">(f) <em>After contract award:</em> When a proposed modification is for new work outside the scope of the original contract, the contracting officer must submit a new J&amp;A as a stand-alone document to the appropriate approving authority based on the dollar value of the contract action for the new work. New work should not commence until the new J&amp;A is approved unless authorized in accordance with FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency. See <a href="[rp:link:affars-part-5343]">5343.102-90</a> regarding contract scope considerations.</p>
