<p class="List1">(a) The objectives of the business and contract clearance process are to ensure that:</p>
<p class="List2">(1) Contract actions effectively implement approved acquisition strategies;</p>
<p class="List2">(2) Negotiations and contract actions result in fair and reasonable business arrangements;</p>
<p class="List2">(3) Negotiations and contract actions are consistent with laws, regulations, and policies; and </p>
<p class="List2">(4) An independent review and assessment by the clearance authority for the proposed contract action is accomplished.</p>
<p class="List1">(b) The CAA must ensure that the clearance process meets the objectives in paragraph (a) above. See AF PGI 5301.9001(b) for guidance on the use of multi-functional independent review teams (MIRTS) in conjunction with competitive acquisitions. </p>
<p class="List1">(c) The CAA must seek legal advice (see 5301.602-2(c)(i)) and ensure that counsel has coordinated on any clearance briefings or presentations, and that counsel&rsquo;s comments are included in the briefing or presentation. </p>
<p class="List1"><span style="color:#000000 !important">(d) Only one clearance review may be performed prior to the contract action being presented to t</span>he CAA. The CR is responsible for the clearance review. The CAA may select an alternate CR who meets the requirements identified in paragraph 5301.9000(f). The CAA, in conjunction with the SCO, has the authority to waive the clearance review. </p>
<p class="List1">(e) At the discretion of the CAA, contract clearance is not required when the negotiation team stays within the pre-set negotiation range and the parameters approved at the business clearance.</p>
<p class="List1">(f) If a CAA requires clearance for competitive order solicitations or orders when excluded in accordance with 5301.9000(b)(6), the SCO must submit a written justification to <a href="mailto:SAF.AQ.SAF-AQC.Workflow@us.af.mil">SAF/AQC</a> upon execution. </p>
<p class="List1">(g)<span style="color:#000000 !important">  The Source Selection Authority (SSA) must not be the CAA</span></p>
<p class="List1">(h) The Milestone Decision Authority, PEO, or lead program manager must coordinate and/or participate in business clearance briefings. </p>
<p class="List1">(i) Contract actions meeting the contract value thresholds set below must not be awarded without obtaining the required <a href="https://usaf.dps.mil/sites/AFCC/KnowledgeCenter/contracting_templates/request_for_clearance.pdf">business and contract clearance approval</a>. Contract value is determined by the definition in FAR 1.108(c) and AF PGI 5301.108(c). </p>
<p class="List2">(1) Clearance Approval: </p>
<p class="List3">(i) The DAS(C) or ADAS(C) is the business clearance approval authority for all contract actions &ge;$1B; and any other contract action identified as special interest by the DAS(C) or ADAS(C) regardless of dollar amount. The DAS(C) or ADAS(C) may delegate clearance authority on a case-by-case basis. The procedures in MP5301.9001(i)(1)(i) must be followed for clearance with the DAS(C) or ADAS(C). SCOs retain contract clearance approval authority.<br></p>
<p class="List3">(ii) The CAA is the approval authority for all contract actions as delegated in TABLE 1 below. The Table 1 thresholds represent the minimum delegation that must be made. SCOs may increase the specified dollar thresholds at their discretion. </p>
<p class="List3">(iii) If a SCO reduces the thresholds or withholds the clearance approval authority from the designees in TABLE 1 below, the SCO must notify <a href="mailto:SAF.AQ.SAF-AQC.Workflow@us.af.mil">SAF/AQC</a>. If the SCO reduces or withholds clearance approval authority for more than six months, the SCO must brief the DAS(C) regarding the circumstances surrounding the decision.</p>

<p class="List1">(a) MAJCOM/DRU/AFRCO/SMC/SpRCO Commanders must appoint an experienced senior official who is independent of the contracting officer and program manager as the ombudsman at their organization. For AFMC Centers, an ombudsman is required at each Center, instead of at the MAJCOM. Centers may also have an ombudsman at each Operating Location/Geographically Separated Unit. </p>
<p class="List1">(b) The ombudsman will have the authority to call upon other resources of the activity to assist in resolving acquisition issues or concerns (e.g., administrative support, independent review teams).</p>
<p class="List1">(c) Contracting officers must identify the ombudsman in the initial announcement of the acquisition as well as in the draft and final RFP.</p>
<p class="List1">(d) The ombudsman must:</p>
<p class="List2">(1) Support acquisition personnel in the resolution of issues or concerns raised by interested parties;</p>
<p class="List2">(2) Act in a manner that does not compromise the interested party and, if requested, maintain anonymity of the parties;</p>
<p class="List2">(3) Avoid any appearance of usurping normal procurement authority (e.g., program manager, contracting officer, and source selection authority);</p>
<p class="List2">(4) Ensure all affected or knowledgeable offices and officials are consulted as part of any resolution process;</p>
<p class="List2">(5) Inform the Commander/Director, or PEO, as required, of issues raised and actions taken; </p>
<p class="List2">(6) Review complaints relative to multiple-award task and delivery order contracts awarded under 10 U.S.C. 2304a(d)(1)(B) or 2304b(e) to ensure that all contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task and delivery orders in excess of the micro-purchase threshold, consistent with the procedures in the contract;</p>
<p class="List2">(7) Consistent with security requirements, have access to the appropriate offices and be allowed to collect all facts relevant to the resolution of issues raised by interested parties. Ombudsmen are granted access to proprietary information. Source selection information must be obtained through the source selection authority.</p>
<p class="List1">(e) The Ombudsman Program does not replace the agency level protest, GAO bid protest or disputes processes.</p>
<p class="List1">(f) The Air Force ombudsman is the ADAS(C), who may take action to assist in resolving issues, concerns, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU/SMC level, or for those having Air Force wide implications. The ADAS(C) is the AF ombudsman for procurement integrity issues (see <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/policy/policyvault/USA004579-09-DPAP.pdf">OUSD(AT&amp;L)/DPAP memo, 1 Oct 09</a>).</p>
<p class="List1">(g) Government personnel may use the Ombudsman Program as a way to express concerns about an acquisition.</p>
