<p>(c) &ldquo;Business Clearance&rdquo; means:</p>
<p>(1) For competitive acquisitions, approval to issue the solicitation.</p>

<h3>
<a id="_Toc45291394"></a>5301.9001 Policy, Thresholds, and Approvals</h3>
<p>(a) The objectives of the business and contract clearance process are to ensure that:</p>
<p>(1) Contract actions effectively implement approved acquisition strategies;</p>
<p>(2) Negotiations and contract actions result in fair and reasonable business arrangements;</p>
<p>(3) Negotiations and contract actions are consistent with laws, regulations, and policies; and </p>
<p>(4) An independent review and assessment by the clearance authority for the proposed contract action is accomplished.</p>
<p>(b) The CAA must ensure that the clearance process meets the objectives in paragraph (a) above. See AF PGI 5301.9001(b) for guidance on the use of multi-functional independent review teams (MIRTS) in conjunction with competitive acquisitions. </p>
<p>(c) The CAA must seek legal advice (see 5301.602-2(c)(i)) and ensure that counsel has coordinated on any clearance briefings or presentations, and that counsel&rsquo;s comments are included in the briefing or presentation. </p>
<p><span style="color:#000000">(d) Only one clearance review may be performed prior to the contract action being presented to t</span>he CAA. The CR is responsible for the clearance review. The CAA may select an alternate CR who meets the requirements identified in paragraph 5301.9000(f). The CAA, in conjunction with the SCO, has the authority to waive the clearance review. </p>
<p>(e) At the discretion of the CAA, contract clearance is not required when the negotiation team stays within the pre-set negotiation range and the parameters approved at the business clearance.</p>
<p><span style="color:#auto"><em>(f)  </em></span><span style="color:#000000">The CAA must justify, in writing, requiring clearance for the solicitation or award of any competitive task or delivery order, regardless of dollar value, made in accordance with FAR 8.4, 13, or 16.505.

On a case-by-case basis, the SCO may review a specific contract action below the established threshold in order to ensure compliance with applicable standards and practices. The SCO may lower the threshold below $3M or rescind a previously granted increased threshold for a subordinate contracting unit. <br><span style="color:#0000FF">INTERIM CHANGE:  </span><span style="color:#000000">See </span><a href="https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/Documents/Contracting_Memos/Policy/20-C-02.pdf"> Policy Memo 20-C-02</a><span style="color:#000000">.</span></p>

<a id="_Toc45291395"></a>SUBPART 5301.91 &ndash; OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM</h2>
<h3>
<a id="_Toc45291396"></a>5301.9101 Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of the Air Force ombudsman program is to foster communication between Government and industry. The primary function of the ombudsman is to hear concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, to communicate these concerns to senior management personnel responsible for oversight and to assist in the resolution of the concerns. In accordance with <a href="#p53019102f">5301.9102(f)</a> below, employees, managers and customers may use the Air Force component ombudsman when seeking assistance in resolving procurement integrity issues.</p>
<h3>
<a id="_Toc45291397"></a>5301.9102 Policy</h3>
<p>(a) MAJCOM/DRU/AFRCO/SMC/SpRCO Commanders must appoint an experienced senior official who is independent of the contracting officer and program manager as the ombudsman at their organization. For AFMC Centers, an ombudsman is required at each Center, instead of at the MAJCOM. Centers may also have an ombudsman at each Operating Location/Geographically Separated Unit. </p>
<p>(b) The ombudsman will have the authority to call upon other resources of the activity to assist in resolving acquisition issues or concerns (e.g., administrative support, independent review teams).</p>
<p>(c) Contracting officers must identify the ombudsman in the initial announcement of the acquisition as well as in the draft and final RFP.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman must:</p>
<p>(1) Support acquisition personnel in the resolution of issues or concerns raised by interested parties;</p>
<p>(2) Act in a manner that does not compromise the interested party and, if requested, maintain anonymity of the parties;</p>
<p>(3) Avoid any appearance of usurping normal procurement authority (e.g., program manager, contracting officer, and source selection authority);</p>
<p>(4) Ensure all affected or knowledgeable offices and officials are consulted as part of any resolution process;</p>
<p>(5) Inform the Commander/Director, or PEO, as required, of issues raised and actions taken; </p>
<p>(6) Review complaints relative to multiple-award task and delivery order contracts awarded under 10 U.S.C. 2304a(d)(1)(B) or 2304b(e) to ensure that all contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task and delivery orders in excess of the micro-purchase threshold, consistent with the procedures in the contract;</p>
<p>(7) Consistent with security requirements, have access to the appropriate offices and be allowed to collect all facts relevant to the resolution of issues raised by interested parties. Ombudsmen are granted access to proprietary information. Source selection information must be obtained through the source selection authority.</p>
<p>(e) The Ombudsman Program does not replace the agency level protest, GAO bid protest or disputes processes.</p>
<p>(f) The Air Force ombudsman is the ADAS(C), who may take action to assist in resolving issues, concerns, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU/SMC level, or for those having Air Force wide implications. The ADAS(C) is the AF ombudsman for procurement integrity issues (see <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/policy/policyvault/USA004579-09-DPAP.pdf">OUSD(AT&amp;L)/DPAP memo, 1 Oct 09</a>).</p>
<p>(g) Government personnel may use the Ombudsman Program as a way to express concerns about an acquisition.</p>
