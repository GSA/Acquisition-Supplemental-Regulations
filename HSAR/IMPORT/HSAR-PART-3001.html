<p><a name="P32_1205"></a><b>3001.101 Purpose.</b></p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) establishes uniform acquisition policies and procedures, which implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).</p>

<p><a name="P34_1417"></a><b>3001.102 Statement of Guiding Principles for the Federal Acquisition System.</b></p>

<p>(d) The FAR and this supplement are to be interpreted permissively, if consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements, policy, and sound professional judgment.</p>

<p><a name="P36_1659"></a><b>3001.103 Authority. </b></p>

<p>The HSAR is issued by DHSâ€™s Chief Procurement Officer, who is the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE), see 41 U.S.C. 1702 and DHS Delegation Number 0702, under authority of 5 U.S.C. 301-302, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, Pub. L. No. 93-400, 88 Stat. 796 (1974), including sections 22 and 25, 41 U.S.C. 1707, 1302 and 1303, and (FAR) 48 CFR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.html">part 1</a></u></font>, <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#s13. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.html">subpart 1.3</a></u></font>.</p>

<p><a name="P38_2056"></a><b>3001.104 Applicability.</b></p>

<p>(a) The following order of precedence applies to resolve any acquisition regulation or procedural inconsistency found within HSAR or the Homeland Security Acquisition Manual (HSAM):</p>

  <ul><p>(1) Statute;</p>

  <p>(2) FAR or other applicable regulation or Executive Order;</p>

  <p>(3) HSAR;</p>

  <p>(4) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Directives; and</p>

  <p>(5) HSAM (which establishes uniform DHS-wide acquisition procedures).</p>

</ul><p>(b) The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) exception to this regulation is authorized by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001 (ATSA) (section 101(a) of Public Law 107-71, as implemented at section 114(o) of title 49) for contracts awarded by TSA pursuant to this ATSA authority. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, Public Law 110-161, Division E, Title V, section 568 eliminates ATSA section 114(o) effective June 23, 2008. Accordingly, TSA acquisitions initiated after June 22, 2008 are subject to 48 CFR Chapters 1 and 30.</p>

<p>(c) Contracts involving Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs) must contain suitable dispute provisions and may provide for appellate dispute jurisdiction in the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA). However, the contract must not attempt to confer court jurisdiction that does not otherwise exist.</p>

<p>(d) The FAR and HSAR may be followed, where feasible, for:</p>

  <ul><p>(1) No-cost contracts;</p>

  <p>(2) Concession contracts; and</p>

  <p>(3) Contracts on behalf of NAFIs entered into by appropriated fund contracting officers.</p>

</ul><p><a name="P51_3533"></a><b>3001.105 Issuance.</b></p>

<p><a name="P52_3551"></a><b>3001.105-1 Publication and code arrangement.</b></p>

<p>(a) The HSAR is published in:</p>

  <ul><p>(1) The <b>Federal Register </b>and</p>

  <p>(2) Cumulated form in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).</p>

</ul><p><a name="P56_3712"></a><b>3001.105-2 Arrangement of regulations.</b></p>

<p>(a) General. The HSAR, which encompasses both Department-wide and Component-unique guidance, conforms to the arrangement and numbering system prescribed by (FAR) 48 CFR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#b11052. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.html">1.105-2</a></u></font>.

<p><a name="P68_5114"></a><b>3001.106 OMB Approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.</b></p>

<p>(a) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has assigned the following control numbers that must appear on the upper right-hand corner of the face page of each solicitation, contract, modification, and order:</p>

<p>OMB Control No.  1600-0002  (Contract related forms) </p>

<p>OMB Control No.  1600-0005  (Offeror submissions) </p>

<p>OMB Control No.  1600-0003  (Contractor submissions) </p>

<p>OMB Control No.  1600-0004  (Protests) </p>

<p>(b) OMB regulations and OMB's approval and assignment of control numbers are conditioned upon not requiring more than three copies (including the original) of any document of information. OMB has granted a waiver to permit the Department to require up to eight copies of proposal packages, including proprietary data, for solicitations, provided that contractors who submit only an original and two copies will not be placed at a disadvantage.</p>

<p><a name="P75_6018"></a><b>Subpart 3001.3 Agency Acquisition Regulations</b></p>

<p><a name="P76_6063"></a><b>3001.301 Policy.</b></p>

<p>(a)(1) The HSAR is issued for Departmental guidance according to the policy cited in (FAR) 48 CFR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#b1301. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.html">1.301</a></u></font>. The HSAR establishes uniform Department of Homeland Security policies and procedures for all acquisition activities within the Department of Homeland Security. Component supplemental acquisition regulations to be inserted in the HSAR as a HSAR supplement regulation must be reviewed and approved by the Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) before the CPO authorizes and submits the proposed content for publication in the Federal Register under (FAR) 48 CFR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.html">part 1</a></u></font>, subparts <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#s13. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.html">1.3</a></u></font> and <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#s15. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.html">1.5</a></u></font>.</p>

  <blockquote>
<p>(2)(i) The CPO is authorized to issue internal agency guidance at any organizational level.  Department-wide procedures are contained in the HSAM.  The HCA may implement internal procedures or supplement the FAR, HSAR, or HSAM as provided in HSAM 3001.3.  The HCA may issue procedures or delegate this authority to any organizational level deemed appropriate. Component procedures may be more restrictive or require higher approval levels than those permitted by the HSAM, unless otherwise specified (ii) Individuals granted authority in the HSAR may delegate that authority, unless the FAR or HSAR specifically state that the authority is not delegable.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>(b) The Under Secretary of Management established procedures through Management Directive (MD) 0490.1, entitled <u>Federal Register Notice and Rules,</u> to ensure that agency acquisition regulations are published for comment in the Federal Register in conformance with FAR procedures at (FAR) 48 CFR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#s15. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.html">Subpart 1.5</a></u></font>.</p>

<p><a name="P80_7626"></a><b>3001.301-70 Amendment of HSAR.</b></p>

<p>(a) Requests for changes to the regulation may be recommended by DHS personnel, other Government agencies, or the public. Change requests are to be submitted in the following format to the Department of Homeland Security, ATTN: Office of the Under Secretary of Management, Chief Procurement Officer, Washington, DC 20528.</p>

  <blockquote>
<p>(1) Problem: Succinctly state the problem(s) created by current HSAR requirements or processes and describe the factual or legal reasons for requesting a regulatory change.</p>

  </blockquote>
<ul><p>(2) Recommendation: Identify the recommended change by using the current language and lining through the words to be deleted and inserting proposed language in brackets. If the change is extensive, deleted language may be displayed by forming a box with diagonal lines connecting the corners.</p>

  </ul><blockquote>
<p>(3) Discussion: Explain why the change is necessary and how the change will solve the problem. Address any cost or administrative impact on Government activities, offerors, and contractors. Provide any other helpful information and documents such as statutes, legal decisions, regulations, reports, etc.</p>

  <p>(4) Point of Contact: Provide a point of contact for answering questions regarding the recommendation, along with a telephone number, e-mail or other method of reaching the contact.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>(b) The HSAR is maintained by the CPO through the HSAR/HSAM change process (i.e., input from various Components including representatives specifically designated to formulate Departmental acquisition policies and procedures)</p>

  <blockquote>
<p>(1) Homeland Security Acquisition Circular (HSAC). HSAC (see (HSAR) 48 Chapter <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><a href="3001.html">3001.301-72</a></u></font>) will be used to amend (HSAR) 48 Chapter 30.</p>

  <p>(2) HSAR Notices will be issued (with a specified expiration date) when interim guidance is necessary under any of the following circumstances:</p>

    <ul><p>(i) To promulgate, as rapidly as possible, selected material in a general or narrative manner, in advance of a HSAC issuance;</p>

    </ul></blockquote>
<ul><ul><p>(ii) To disseminate other acquisition related information; or</p>

    </ul><blockquote>
<p>(iii) To issue guidance that is expected to be effective for a period of 1 year or less. </p>

</blockquote>
</ul><p><a name="P92_9702"></a><b>3001.301-71 Effective date.</b></p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated:</p>

<p>(a) HSAR changes apply to solicitations issued on or after the effective date of the change;</p>

<p>(b) Contracting officers may, at their discretion, amend solicitations issued before the effective date to include HSAR changes, provided award of the resulting contract(s) will occur on or after the effective date; and</p>

<p>(c) When required by law, contracting officers must modify existing contracts to include HSAR changes. Otherwise, and where feasible, contracting officers should consider using the Changes clause or other suitable authority, to modify existing contracts to include HSAR changes.</p>

<p><a name="P97_10341"></a><b>3001.301-72 HSAC or HSAR Notice numbering.</b></p>

<p>HSACs and HSAR Notices will be numbered consecutively on a fiscal year basis beginning with number "01" prefixed by the last two digits of the fiscal year (e.g., HSAR Notices 03-0 1 and 03-02 indicate the first two HSAR Notices issued in fiscal year 2003).</p>

<p><a name="P99_10639"></a><b>3001.303 Publication and codification.</b></p>

<p>(a) The HSAR is issued as chapter 30 of Title 48 of the CFR.</p>

  <ul><p>(1) The FAR numbering illustrations at (FAR) 48 CFR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#b11052. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.html">1.105-2</a></u></font> apply to the HSAR.</p>

  </ul><blockquote>
<p>(2) Coverage within HSAR 48 CFR chapter 30 is identified by the prefix "30" followed by the complete FAR cite which may extend downward to the subparagraph level (e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><a href="3001.html">3001.101</a></u></font>).</p>

  <p>(3) Coverage in HSAR chapter 30 that supplements the FAR will use part, subpart, section, and subsection numbers ending in "70" through "89". A series of numbers beginning with "70" is used for provisions and clauses (e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><a href="3001.html">3001.301-70</a></u></font>)</p>

  <p>(4) Coverage in HSAR 48 CFR chapter 30, other than that identified with a "70" or higher number, which implements the FAR uses the identical number sequence and caption of the FAR segment being implemented which may extend downward to the subparagraph level. Subparagraph numbers/letters may not be shown as sequential, but may be shown by the specific paragraph/subparagraph implemented from the FAR (e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR <font color="#0000ff" size="+0"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .3003.doc#s3003301. --><a href="3003.html">3003.301</a></u></font> contains subparagraphs (a) and (b) because only these subparagraphs, correlating to FAR, are being supplemented by (HSAR) 48 CFR chapter 30).</p>

  <p>(5) Component-unique guidance. Supplementary material for which there is no counterpart in the FAR or HSAR shall be identified using chapter, part, subpart, section, or subsection numbers of "90" and up (e.g., the U.S. Coast Guard's acronym is "USCG"; an USCG-unique clause pertaining to "Inspection and/or Acceptance" would be designated "USCG 3052.246-90").</p>

  <p>(6) References and citations.   Cross references to the FAR in the HSAR will be cited by "FAR" followed by the FAR numbered cite, and cross reference to the HSAM in the HSAR will be cited by "HSAM" followed by the HSAM numbered cite.</p>

<p>(7) Department/agency and Component supplements must parallel the FAR and HSAR numbering, except department/agency supplemental numbering uses subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.</p>

<p>(a) The HSAR is under the direct oversight and control of the Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO), which is responsible for evaluation, review, and issuance of all Department-wide acquisition regulations and guidance.   Each HCA may supplement the HSAR with Component guidance.  Supplementation should be kept to a minimum.  Components proposing to issue regulatory supplements or use solicitation or contract clauses on a repetitive basis must obtain legal review by the Componentâ€™s legal counsel and forward supplements to the CPO for concurrence prior to publication in the Federal Register.</p>

<p>(c) The CPO is responsible for evaluating all regulatory coverage in agency acquisition regulations to determine if the substance could apply to other agencies and to make recommendation for inclusion in the FAR.</p>
