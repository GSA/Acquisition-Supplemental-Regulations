</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Information designated as “For Official Use Only,” which is unclassified information of a sensitive nature and the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely impact a person's privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or operations essential to the national or homeland security interest; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Any information that is designated “sensitive” or subject to other controls, safeguards or protections in accordance with subsequently adopted homeland security information handling procedures.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) “Information Technology Resources” include, but are not limited to, computer equipment, networking equipment, telecommunications equipment, cabling, network drives, computer drives, network software, computer software, software programs, intranet sites, and internet sites.

Completed forms shall be submitted as directed by the Contracting Officer. Upon the Contracting Officer's request, the Contractor's employees shall be fingerprinted, or subject to other investigations as required. All Contractor employees requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive information or IT resources are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract unless this requirement is waived under Departmental procedures.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) The Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to prohibit individuals from working on the contract if the Government deems their initial or continued employment contrary to the public interest for any reason, including, but not limited to, carelessness, insubordination, incompetence, or security concerns.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information. Therefore, the Contractor shall not disclose, orally or in writing, any sensitive information to any person unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. For those Contractor employees authorized access to sensitive information, the Contractor shall ensure that these persons receive training concerning the protection and disclosure of sensitive information both during and after contract performance.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts at any tier where the subcontractor may have access to Government facilities, sensitive information, or resources.</p>

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(h) The Contractor shall have access only to those areas of DHS information technology resources explicitly stated in this contract or approved by the COTR in writing as necessary for performance of the work under this contract.

In the event of violation of this provision, DHS will take appropriate actions with regard to the contract and the individual(s) involved.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(i) Contractor access to DHS networks from a remote location is a temporary privilege for mutual convenience while the Contractor performs business for the DHS Component. It is not a right, a guarantee of access, a condition of the contract, or Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(j) Contractor access will be terminated for unauthorized use.

Within DHS Headquarters, the waiver may be granted only with the approval of both the CSO and the CIO or their designees. In order for a waiver to be granted:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) There must be a compelling reason for using this individual as opposed to a U.S. citizen; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The waiver must be in the best interest of the Government.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(l) Contractors shall identify in their proposals the names and citizenship of all non-U.S. citizens proposed to work under the contract.
