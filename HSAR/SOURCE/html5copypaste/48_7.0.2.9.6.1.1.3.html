         <p class="p List1">(a) DHS policy requires its contracting officers to restrict DHS contractors from referring to its DHS contract(s) in commercial advertising in a manner that states or implies the Government approves or endorses the contractor's products or services or considers them superior to other products or services. The intent of this policy is to prevent the appearance of Government bias toward any product or service.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The Department's contractors share the responsibility for protecting sensitive and classified information related to efforts under their contracts. For any contract that involves sensitive or classified information, prior to the release of any contract award announcement, advertisement, or other release of information pertaining to the contract, the contractor must obtain the approval of the responsible contracting officer.
