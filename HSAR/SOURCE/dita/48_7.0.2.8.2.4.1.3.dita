         <p outputclass="P">DHS policy requires that acquisitions be made only by Government officials having authority to enter into such acquisitions. Acquisitions made by other than authorized personnel are contrary to Departmental policy and may be considered matters of serious misconduct on the part of an employee making an unauthorized commitment, and may result in disciplinary action being taken against an employee who makes an unauthorized commitment.
