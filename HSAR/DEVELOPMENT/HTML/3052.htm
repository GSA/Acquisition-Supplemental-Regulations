<p>(a) The Contractor shall be responsible for Information Technology (IT) security for all systems connected to a DHS network or operated by the Contractor for DHS, regardless of location.

<p>(b) The Contractor shall provide, implement, and maintain an IT Security Plan. This plan shall describe the processes and procedures that will be followed to ensure appropriate security of IT resources that are developed, processed, or used under this contract.</p>

    <ul><ul><p>(1) Within____[“insert number of days”] days after contract award, the contractor shall submit for approval its IT Security Plan, which shall be consistent with and further detail the approach contained in the offeror's proposal. The plan, as approved by the Contracting Officer, shall be incorporated into the contract as a compliance document.</p>

    <p>(2) The Contractor’s IT Security Plan shall comply with Federal laws that include, but are not limited to, the Computer Security Act of 1987 (40 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.); the Government Information Security Reform Act of 2000; and the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002; and with Federal policies and procedures that include, but are not limited to, OMB Circular A-130.</p>

    <p>(3) The security plan shall specifically include instructions regarding handling and protecting sensitive information at the Contractor’s site (including any information stored, processed, or transmitted using the Contractor’s computer systems), and the secure management, operation, maintenance, programming, and system administration of computer systems, networks, and telecommunications systems.</p>

</ul></ul><p>(c) Examples of tasks that require security provisions include--</p>

    <ul><ul><p>(1) Acquisition, transmission or analysis of data owned by DHS with significant replacement cost should the contractor’s copy be corrupted; and</p>

    <p>(2) Access to DHS networks or computers at a level beyond that granted the general public (e.g., such as bypassing a firewall).</p>

</ul></ul><p>(d) At the expiration of the contract, the contractor shall return all sensitive DHS information and IT resources provided to the contractor during the contract, and certify that all non-public DHS information has been purged from any contractor-owned system.

          <p>(B) Owns or is in a position to control another entity that is a subcontractor at any level under the prime contract; and </p>

        </ul><p>(iv) Participating or sharing in the profits of another firm’s development or construction of any individual system or element of any system of systems for which the Contractor is the lead system integrator or agreeing to participate in the profits of the firm from such development or construction.  </p>

    </ul></ul><p>(2)  “Lead system integrator” includes “lead system integrator with system responsibility” and “lead system integrator without system responsibility.”</p>

    <p>(3)  “Lead system integrator with system responsibility” means a prime contractor for the development or production of a major system, if the prime contractor is not expected at the time of award to perform a substantial portion of the work on the system and the major subsystems.</p>

    <p>(4)  “Lead system integrator without system responsibility” means a prime contractor under a contract for the procurement of services, the primary purpose of which is to perform acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions (see section 7.503(d) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation) with regard to the development or production of a major system.</p>

    <p>(5) The phrase “substantial portion of the work,” as used in the definition of “lead system integrator with system responsibility,” may relate to the dollar value of the effort or to the criticality of the effort performed.</p>

</ul></ul><p>(b)  <i>Limitations</i>.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor meets the definition of lead system integrator with [ ]<b> </b>without [ ] system responsibility.  Unless an exception is granted, the Contractor shall not have any direct financial interest in the development or construction of any individual system or element of any system of systems while performing lead system integrator functions in the acquisition of a major system by the Department of Homeland Security under this contract.</p>

<p>(c)  <i>Agreement</i>.  The Contractor agrees that during performance of this contract it will not acquire any direct financial interest as described in paragraph (b) of this clause, or, if it does acquire or plan to acquire such interest, it will immediately notify the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor further agrees to provide to the Contracting Officer all relevant information regarding the change in financial interests so that the Contracting Officer can determine whether an exception applies or whether the Contractor will be allowed to continue performance on this contract.  If an organizational conflict of interest in the performance of this contract that is attributable to the Contractor’s direct financial interest cannot be avoided, eliminated, or mitigated to the Contracting Officer’s satisfaction, the Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for default or may take other remedial measures as appropriate in the Contracting Officer’s sole discretion.</p>

<p>(d)  Notwithstanding any other clause of this contract, if the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor misrepresented its financial interests at the time of award or has violated the agreement in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Government may terminate this contract for default or may take other remedial measures as appropriate in the Contracting Officer’s sole discretion.</p>

<p>(e)  This clause implements the requirements of 6 U.S.C. 396, as added by Section 6405 of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, And Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007  (Pub. L. 110-28).</p>

<p align="center"><b>PROHIBITION ON FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE GUARD SERVICES CONTRACTS WITH BUSINESS CONCERNS OWNED, CONTROLLED, OR OPERATED BY AN INDIVIDUAL CONVICTED OF A FELONY (DEC 2009)</b></p>

<p>(a) Prohibitions. Section 2 of the Federal Protective Service Guard Contracting Reform Act of 2008, Public Law 110-356, generally prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into a contract for guard services under the Federal Protective Service (FPS) guard services program with any business concern owned, controlled, or operated by an individual convicted of a serious felony.</p>

<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>

<p><i>Business concern</i> means a commercial enterprise and the people who constitute it.</p>

<p><i>Felony</i> means an offense which, if committed by a natural person, would be punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</p>

<p><i>Individual</i> means any person, corporation, partnership, or other entity with a legally independent status.</p>

<p><i>Convicted of a felony</i> means any conviction of a felony in violation of state or federal criminal statutes, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice, whether entered on a verdict or plea, including a plea of nolo contendere, for which a sentence has been imposed.<br>
(c) A business concern that is owned, controlled, or operated by an individual who has been convicted of any felony, and that wishes to submit a bid, proposal, or other offer on a solicitation to obtain a FPS contract for guard services, must submit with its offer an award request as specified in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>

    <ul><ul><p>(1) A financial, voting, operational, or employment interest in the business concern of the individual's spouse, child, or other family member, or person with whom the individual shares his or her household, will be imputed to the individual in determining whether the individual owns, controls, or operates a business concern.</p>

    <p>(2) An individual owns, controls, or operates a business concern by fulfilling or holding the following types of roles or interests with respect to the business concern:</p>

        <ul><ul><p>(i) Director or officer, including incumbents of boards and  offices that perform duties ordinarily performed by a chairman or member of a board of directors, a secretary, treasurer, president, a vice president, or other chief official of a business concern, </p>

        <p>including Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, or Chief contracting official.</p>

        <p>(ii) Officials of comparable function and status to those described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this clause as exist in partnerships of all kind and other business organizations, including sole proprietorships.</p>

        <p>(iii) A general partner in a general or limited partnership.</p>

        <p>(iv) An individual with a limited partnership interest of 25% or more.</p>

        <p>(v) An individual that has the:</p>

          <ul><p>(A) Power to vote, directly or indirectly, 25% or more interest in any class of voting stock of the business concern; </p>

          <p>(B) Ability to direct in any manner the election of a majority of the business concern's directors or trustees; or</p>

          <p>(C) Ability to exercise a controlling influence over the business concern's management and policies.</p>

    </ul></ul></ul><p>(3) Generally, the existence of one or more of the roles or interests set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, including roles or interests attributed to the individual, will be sufficient to determine that the individual owns, controls or operates the business concern.  However, specific facts of the case may warrant a different determination by Government in light of all of the facts and circumstances. Conversely, ownership, control, or the ability to operate the business concern, if it exists in fact, can be reflected by other roles or interests, and the offeror or contractor should reveal the existence of felony convictions if there is doubt as to whether the individual owns, controls or operates the business concern.</p>

</ul></ul><p>(d) Award request.</p>

    <ul><ul><p>(1) A business concern owned, operated or controlled by an individual convicted of any felony may submit an award request to the Contracting Officer. The basis for such request shall be either that the subject felony is not a serious felony as defined in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171-5; that such individual no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern; or that commission of the serious felony no longer calls into question the individual or business concern's integrity or business ethics and that an award would be consistent with the mission of FPS. The business concern shall bear the burden of proof for award requests.</p>

    <p>(2) If the Contracting Officer in his or her sole discretion, is unable to affirmatively determine that the subject felony is not a serious felony as defined in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171-5 or that such individual no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern, then the Contracting Officer shall deny the award request.</p>

    <p>(3) The Head of the Contracting Activity has sole discretion to approve an award request.</p>

    <p>(4) A copy of the award request with supporting documentation or a copy of a previously approved award request shall be attached with the bid or proposal.</p>

    <p>(5) An award request shall contain the basis for the request (i.e., that the subject felony is not a serious felony as defined by this regulation; that the convicted individual does not or no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern; or that the commission of a serious felony no longer calls into question the individual or business concern's integrity or business ethics and that an award would be consistent with the mission of FPS). The award request shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:</p>

        <ul><ul><p>(i) Name and Date of Birth of Individual Convicted of a felony.</p>

        <p>(ii) A full description of which roles or interests indicate that the individual owns, controls, or operates or may own control or operate the business concern.</p>

        <p>(iii) Date sentenced.</p>

        <p>(iv) Statute/Charge.</p>

        <p>(v) Docket/Case Number.</p>

        <p>(vi) Court/Jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>(vii) The nature and circumstances surrounding the conviction.</p>

        <p>(viii) Protective measures taken by the individual or business concern to reduce or eliminate the risk of further misconduct.</p>

        <p>(ix) Whether the individual has made full restitution for the felony.</p>

        <p>(x) Whether the individual has accepted responsibility for past misconduct resulting in the felony conviction.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>(6) Upon the request of the Contracting Officer, and prior to contract award, in addition to information described in paragraph (d)(5) of this clause, the business concern must provide such other documentation as is requested by the Contracting Officer to use in determining and evaluating ownership, control, or operation; the nature of the felonies committed; and such other information as is needed to make a decision on whether award should be made to the offeror under the Federal Protective Service Guard Contracting Reform Act of 2008. The refusal to timely provide such documentation may serve as grounds to preclude contract award.</p>

</ul></ul><p>(e) (1) Privacy Statement. The offeror shall provide the following statement to any individual whose information will be submitted in an award request pursuant to (d)(5) and (6) of this clause.<br>
(2) Privacy Notice.  The collection of this information is authorized by the Federal Protective Service Guard Contracting Reform Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-356) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implementing regulations at Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171. This information is being collected to determine whether an individual that owns, controls, or operates the business concern submitting this offer has been convicted of a felony that would disqualify the offeror from receiving an award. This information will be used by and disclosed to DHS personnel and contractors or other agents who require this information to determine whether an award request should be approved or denied. Additionally, DHS may share this personal information with the U.S. Justice Department and other Federal and State agencies for collection, enforcement, investigatory, or litigation purposes, or as otherwise authorized. Submission of this information by the individual is voluntary, however, failure to provide it may result in denial of an award to the offeror.  Individuals who wish to correct inaccurate information in or to remove their information from an offer that has been submitted should contact the business concern submitting the offer and request correction.  Should individuals seek to correct inaccurate information or remove their information from an offer that has been submitted in response to a solicitation for FPS guard services prior to contract award, an authorized representative of the business concern submitting the offer must contact the contracting officer of record and request that the firm's offer be formally withdrawn or submit a correction to the award request. After contract award, it is recommended that an authorized representative of the business concern that submitted the inaccurate or erroneous information contact the contracting officer of record. The contracting officer will handle such requests on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:</p>

<p>    --It is not a business concern owned, controlled, or operated by an individual convicted of a felony.</p>

<p>    --It is a business concern owned, controlled, or operated by an individual convicted of a felony, and has submitted an award request pursuant to paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>

<p>(g) If an award request is applied for, the offeror shall attach the request with supporting documentation, to the bid or proposal. The supporting documentation may include copies of prior award requests granted to the offeror.</p>

<p>(h) The notification in this paragraph applies if this is an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract, blanket purchase agreement, or other contractual instrument that may result in the issuance of task orders, calls or option to extend the terms of a contract. The Contractor must immediately notify the Contracting Officer in writing upon any felony conviction of personnel who own, control or operate a business concern as defined in paragraph (c) of this clause at any time during the performance of this contract.  Upon notification of a felony conviction the Contracting Officer will review and make a new determination of eligibility prior to the issuance of any task order, call or exercise of an option.</p>

<p>(a) When work is to be performed at an operating airport, the Contractor must arrange its work schedule so as not to interfere with flight operations. Such operations will take precedence over construction convenience. Any operations of the Contractor which would otherwise interfere with or endanger the operations of aircraft shall be performed only at times and in the manner directed by the Contracting Officer. The Government will make every effort to reduce the disruption of the Contractor's operation.</p>

<p>(b) Unless otherwise specified by local regulations, all areas in which construction operations are underway shall be marked by yellow flags during daylight hours and by red lights at other times. The red lights along the edge of the construction areas within the existing aprons shall be the electric type of not less than 100 watts intensity placed and supported as required. All other construction markings on roads and adjacent parking lots may be either electric or battery type lights. These lights and flags shall be placed so as to outline the construction areas and the distance between any two flags or lights shall not be greater than 25 feet. The Contractor shall provide adequate watch to maintain the lights in working condition at all times other than daylight hours. The hour of beginning and the hour of ending of daylight will be determined by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(c) All equipment and material in the construction areas or when moved outside the construction area shall be marked with airport safety flags during the day and when directed by the Contracting Officer, with red obstruction lights at nights. All equipment operating on the apron, taxiway, runway, and intermediate areas after darkness hours shall have clearance lights in conformance with instructions from the Contracting Officer. No construction equipment shall operate within 50 feet of aircraft undergoing fuel operations. Open flames are not allowed on the ramp except at times authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(d) Trucks and other motorized equipment entering the airport or construction area shall do so only over routes determined by the Contracting Officer. Use of runways, aprons, taxiways, or parking areas as truck or equipment routes will not be permitted unless specifically authorized for such use. Flag personnel shall be furnished by the Contractor at points on apron and taxiway for safe guidance of its equipment over these areas to assure right of way to aircraft. Areas and routes used during the contract must be returned to their original condition by the Contractor. Airport management shall establish the maximum speed allowed at the airport. Vehicles shall be operated so as to be under safe control at all times, weather and traffic conditions considered. Vehicles must be equipped with head and taillights during the hours of darkness.</p>

The Contracting Officer will provide a written notice of such designation to the Contractor within five working days after contract award or for construction, not less than five working days prior to giving the contractor the notice to proceed.
