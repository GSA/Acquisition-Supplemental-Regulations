         <p xtrc="P">FAR subpart 15.1 has no practical application to the FEHB Program because prospective contractors (carriers) are considered for inclusion in the FEHB Program according to criteria in 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 and 5 CFR part 890 rather than by competition between prospective carriers.
