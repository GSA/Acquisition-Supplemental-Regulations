         <p outputclass="List1">(a) <i>General.</i> The FEHBAR conforms with the arrangement and numbering system prescribed by FAR 1.104.

</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) FAR; 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) FEHBAR. 
</p>
         <p props="Runin" outputclass="List1">(b) <i>Citation.</i>

</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) In informal documents, any section of chapter 16 may be identified as “FEHBAR” followed by the section number.
