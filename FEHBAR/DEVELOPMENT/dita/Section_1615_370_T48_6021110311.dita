         <p xtrc="P">FAR subpart 15.3 has no practical application to the FEHBP because prospective contractors (carriers) are considered for inclusion in the FEHBP in accordance with criteria provided in 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 and 5 CFR part 890 rather than on the basis of competition <i>between</i> prospective carriers.
