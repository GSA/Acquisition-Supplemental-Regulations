</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) An entity's subscriber groups may be included as an SSSG if the entity is any of the following:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The carrier;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) A division or subsidiary of the carrier;

</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) An entity that maintains a contractual arrangement with the carrier to provide healthcare benefits.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) A subscriber group covered by an entity meeting any of the criteria under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be included for comparison as a SSSG if the entity meets any of the following criteria:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) It reports financial statements on a consolidated basis with the carrier; or
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Shares, delegates, or otherwise contracts with the carrier, any portion of its workforce that involves the management, design, pricing, or marketing of the healthcare product.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) A purchasing alliance whose rate-setting is mandated by the State or local government;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Administrative Service Organizations (ASOs);

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) OPM shall determine the FEHBP rate by selecting the lowest rate derived by using rating methods consistent with those used to derive the SSSG rate.

         <p class="p List1">(b) The FEHB-specific MLR will be calculated on an annual basis. This FEHB-specific MLR will be measured against an FEHB-specific MLR threshold to be put forth by OPM no later than 12 calendar months before the beginning of plan years 2014 and beyond.
