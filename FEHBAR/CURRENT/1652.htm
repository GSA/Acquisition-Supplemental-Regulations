<p>Filing Health Benefit Claims/Court Review of Disputed Claims (MAR 1995)</p>

<p>(a) <i>General.</i> (1) The Carrier resolves claims filed under the Plan. All health benefit claims must be submitted initially to the Carrier. If the Carrier denies a claim (or a portion of a claim), the covered individual may ask the Carrier to reconsider its denial. If the Carrier affirms its denial or fails to respond as required by paragraph (b) of this clause, the covered individual may ask OPM to review the claim. A covered individual must exhaust both the Carrier and OPM review processes specified in this clause before seeking judicial review of the denied claim. </p>

<p>(2) This clause applies to covered individuals and to other individuals or entities who are acting on the behalf of a covered individual and who have the covered individual's specific written consent to pursue payment of the disputed claim. </p>

<p>(b) Time limits for reconsidering a claim. (1) The covered individual has 6 months from the date of the notice to the covered individual that a claim (or a portion of a claim) was denied by the Carrier in which to submit a written request for reconsideration to the Carrier. The time limit for requesting reconsideration may be extended when the covered individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit. </p>

<p>(2) The Carrier has 30 days after the date of receipt of a timely-filed request for reconsideration to: </p>

<p>(i) Affirm the denial in writing to the covered individual;</p>

<p>(ii) Pay the bill or provide the service; or </p>

<p>(iii) Request from the covered individual or provider additional information needed to make a decision on the claim. The Carrier must simultaneously notify the covered individual of the information requested if it requests additional information from a provider. The Carrier has 30 days after the date the information is received to affirm the denial in writing to the covered individual or pay the bill or provide the service. The Carrier must make its decision based on the evidence it has if the covered individual or provider does not respond within 60 days after the date of the Carrier's notice requesting additional information. The Carrier must then send written notice to the covered individual of its decision on the claim. The covered individual may request OPM review as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause if the Carrier fails to act within the time limit set forth in this paragraph. </p>

<p>(3) The covered individual may write to OPM and request that OPM review the Carrier's decision if the Carrier either affirms its denial of a claim or fails to respond to a covered individual's written request for reconsideration within the time limit set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause. The covered individual must submit the request for OPM review within the time limit specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause. </p>

<p>(4) The Carrier may extend the time limit for a covered individual's submission of additional information to the Carrier when the covered individual shows he or she was not notified of the time limit or was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the additional information. </p>

<p>(c) <i>Information required to process requests for reconsideration.</i> (1) The covered individual must put the request to the Carrier to reconsider a claim in writing and give the reasons, in terms of applicable brochure provisions, that the denied claim should have been approved. </p>

<p>(2) If the Carrier needs additional information from the covered individual to make a decision, it must: </p>

<p>(i) Specifically identify the information needed; </p>

<p>(ii) State the reason the information is required to make a decision on the claim; </p>

<p>(iii) Specify the time limit (60 days after the date of the Carrier's request) for submitting the information; and </p>

<p>(iv) State the consequences of failure to respond within the time limit specified, as set out in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. </p>

<p>(d) <i>Carrier determinations.</i> The Carrier must provide written notice to the covered individual of its determination. If the Carrier affirms the initial denial, the notice must inform the covered individual of: </p>

<p>(1) The specific and detailed reasons for the denial; </p>

<p>(2) The covered individual's right to request a review by OPM; and </p>

<p>(3) The requirement that requests for OPM review must be received within 90 days after the date of the Carrier's denial notice and include a copy of the denial notice as well as documents to support the covered individual's position. </p>

<p>(e) <i>OPM review.</i> (1) If the covered individual seeks further review of the denied claim, the covered individual must make a request to OPM to review the Carrier's decision. Such a request to OPM must be made: </p>

<p>(i) Within 90 days after the date of the Carrier's notice to the covered individual that the denial was affirmed; or </p>

<p>(ii) If the Carrier fails to respond to the covered individual as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, within 120 days after the date of the covered individual's timely request for reconsideration by the Carrier; or </p>

<p>(iii) Within 120 days after the date the Carrier requests additional information from the covered individual, or the date the covered individual is notified that the Carrier is requesting additional information from a provider. OPM may extend the time limit for a covered individual's request for OPM review when the covered individual shows he or she was not notified of the time limit or was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the request for OPM review within the time limit. </p>

<p>(2) In reviewing a claim denied by the Carrier, OPM may:</p>

<p>(i) Request that the covered individual submit additional information; </p>

<p>(ii) Obtain an advisory opinion from an independent physician; </p>

<p>(iii) Obtain any other information as may in its judgment be required to make a determination; or </p>

<p>(iv) Make its decision based solely on the information the covered individual provided with his or her request for review. </p>

<p>(3) When OPM requests information from the Carrier, the Carrier must release the information within 30 days after the date of OPM's written request unless a different time limit is specified by OPM in its request. </p>

<p>(4) Within 90 days after receipt of the request for review, OPM will either: </p>

<p>(i) Give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual and the Carrier; or </p>

<p>(ii) Notify the individual of the status of the review. If OPM does not receive requested evidence within 15 days after expiration of the applicable time limit in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, OPM may make its decision based solely on information available to it at that time and give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual and to the Carrier. </p>

<p>Large Provider Agreements (OCT 2005) </p>

<p>(a) <i>Notification and Information Requirements.</i> (1) The experience-rated Carrier must provide notice to the contracting officer of its intent to enter into or to make a significant modification of a Large Provider Agreement:</p>

<p>(i) Not less than 60 days before entering into any Large Provider Agreement; and</p>

<p>(ii) Not less than 60 days before exercising a renewal or other option, or significant modification to a Large Provider Agreement, when such action would result in total costs to the FEHB Program of an additional 20 percent or more above the existing contract. However, if a carrier is exercising a simple renewal or other option contemplated by a Large Provider Agreement that OPM previously reviewed, and there are no significant changes, then a statement to the effect that the renewal or other option is being exercised along with the dollar amount is sufficient notice.</p>

<p>(2) The carrier's notification to the contracting officer must be in writing and must, at a minimum:</p>

<p>(i) Describe the supplies and/or services the proposed provider agreement will require;</p>

<p>(ii) Identify the proposed basis for reimbursement;</p>

<p>(iii) Identify the proposed provider agreement, explain why the carrier selected the proposed provider, and what contracting method it used, where applicable, including the kind of competition obtained;</p>

<p>(iv) Describe the methodology the carrier used to compute the provider's profit; and,</p>

<p>(v) Describe provider risk provisions.</p>

<p>(3) The Contracting officer may request from the carrier any additional information on a proposed provider agreement and its terms and conditions prior to a provider award and during the performance of the agreement.</p>

<p>(4) Within 30 days of receiving the carrier's notification, the Contracting officer will give the carrier either written comments or written notice that there will be no comments. If the Contracting officer comments, the carrier must respond in writing within 10 calendar days, and explain how it intends to address any concerns.</p>

<p>(5) When computing the carrier's service charge, the Contracting officer will consider how well the carrier complies with the provisions of this section, including the advance notification requirements, as an aspect of the carrier's performance factor.</p>

<p>(6) The Contracting officer's review of any Large Provider Agreement, option, renewal, or modification will not constitute a determination of the acceptability of the terms and conditions of any provider agreement or of the allowability of any costs under the carrier's contract, nor will it relieve the carrier of any responsibility for performing the contract.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Records and Inspection.</i> The carrier must insert in all Large Provider Agreements the requirement that the provider will retain and make available to the Government all records relating to the agreement that support the annual statement of operations and enrollee records—Retain for 6 years after the agreement term ends.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Audit and Records—Negotiation.</i> The provisions of FAR 52.215–2, “Audit and Records—Negotiation,” when required, or FEHBAR 1652.246–70, “FEHB Inspection” apply to all experience-rated Carriers' Large Provider Agreements. The Carrier will insert the clauses at FAR 52.215–2, when applicable, or FEHBAR 1652.246–70 in all Large Provider Agreements. In FAR 52.215–2 the carrier will substitute:</p>

<p>(1) The term “Large Provider” for the term “Contractor” throughout the clause, and</p>

<p>(2) The term “Large Provider Agreement” for the term “Subcontracts” in paragraph (g) of FAR 52.215–2. The term “Contracting officer” will mean the FEHB Program Contracting officer at OPM. The carrier will be responsible for ensuring the Large Provider complies with the provisions set forth in the clause.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Prohibited Agreements.</i> No provider agreement made under this contract will provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis.</p>

<p>(e) The carrier will insert this clause, 1652.204–74, in all Large Provider Agreements.</p>

<p>Rate Reduction for Defective Pricing or Defective Cost or Pricing Data (JAN 2004)</p>

<p>(a) If any rate established in connection with this contract was increased because:</p>

<p>(1) The Carrier submitted, or kept in its files in support of the FEHBP rate, cost or pricing data that were not complete, accurate, or current as certified in one of the Certificates of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data (FEHBAR 1615.406-2);</p>

<p>(2) The Carrier submitted, or kept in its files in support of the FEHBP rate, cost or pricing data that were not accurate as represented in the rate reconciliation documents or MLR Calculation;</p>

<p>(3) The Carrier developed FEHBP rates for traditional community rated plans with a rating methodology and structure inconsistent with that used to develop rates for a similarly sized subscriber group (see FEHBAR 1602.170-13) as certified in the Certificate of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data for Community Rated Carriers;</p>

<p>(4) The Carrier, who is not mandated by the State to use traditional community rating, developed FEHBP rates with a rating methodology and structure inconsistent with its State-filed rating methodology (or if not required to file with the State, their standard written and established rating methodology) or inconsistent with the FEHB specific medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements (see FEHBAR 1602.170-13); or</p>

<p>(5) The Carrier submitted or, kept in its files in support of the FEHBP rate, data or information of any description that were not complete, accurate, and current—then, the rate shall be reduced in the amount by which the price was increased because of the defective data or information.</p>

<p>(b)(1) If the Contracting Officer determines under paragraph (a) of this clause that a price or cost reduction should be made, the Carrier agrees not to raise the following matters as a defense: </p>

<p>(i) The Carrier was a sole source supplier or otherwise was in a superior bargaining position and thus the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted or maintained and identified. </p>

<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the Carrier took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the Contracting Officer. </p>

<p>(iii) The contract was based on an agreement about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under the contract. </p>

<p>(iv) The Carrier did not submit or keep in its files a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. </p>

<p>(2)(i) Except as prohibited by subdivision (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, an offset in an amount determined appropriate by the Contracting Officer based upon the facts shall be allowed against the amount of a contract price reduction if— </p>

<p>(A) The Carrier certifies to the Contracting Officer that, to the best of the Carrier's knowledge and belief, the Carrier is entitled to the offset in the amount requested; and </p>

<p>(B) The Carrier proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) and that the data were not submitted before such date. </p>

<p>(ii) An offset shall not be allowed if— </p>

<p>(A) The understated data was known by the Carrier to be understated when the Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data was signed; or</p>

<p>(B) The Government proves that the facts demonstrate that the contract price would not have increased in the amount to be offset even if the available data had been submitted before the date of agreement on price.</p>

<p>(c) When the Contracting Officer determines that the rates shall be reduced and the Government is thereby entitled to a refund or that the Government is entitled to a MLR penalty, the Carrier shall be liable to and shall pay the FEHB Fund at the time the overpayment is repaid or at the time the MLR penalty is paid—</p>

<p>(1) Simple interest on the amount of the overpayment from the date the overpayment was paid from the FEHB Fund to the Carrier until the date the overcharge is liquidated. In calculating the amount of interest due, the quarterly rate determinations by the Secretary of the Treasury under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2) applicable to the periods the overcharge was retained by the Carrier shall be used;</p>

<p>(2) A penalty equal to the amount of overpayment, if the Carrier knowingly submitted cost or pricing data which was incomplete, inaccurate, or noncurrent; and,</p>

<p>(3) Simple interest on the MLR penalty from the date on which the penalty should have been paid to the FEHB Fund to the date on which the penalty was or will be actually paid to the FEHB fund. The interest rate shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p>

<p>(d) Investment income lost as a result of unallowable, unallocable, or unreasonable charges against the contract shall be paid from the 1st day of the contract term following the contract term in which the unallowable charge was made and shall end on the earlier of: (1) The date the amounts are returned to the Special Reserve (or the Office of Personnel Management); (2) the date specified by the Contracting Officer; or, (3) the date of the Contracting Officer's Final Decision.</p>

<p>(e) Investment income lost as a result of failure to credit income due the contract or failure to place excess funds in income producing investments and accounts shall be paid from the date the funds should have been invested or appropriate income was not credited and shall end on the earlier of: (1) The date the amounts are returned to the Special Reserve (or the Office of Personnel Management); (2) the date specified by the Contracting Officer; or, (3) the date of the Contracting Officer's Final Decision.</p>

<p>Accounting and Price Adjustment (JAN 2003)</p>

<p>(a) <i>Annual Accounting Statement.</i> The Carrier, not later than 90 days after the end of each contract period, shall furnish to OPM for that contract period an accounting of its operations under the contract. The accounting shall be in the form prescribed by OPM.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Adjustment.</i> (1) This contract is community rated as defined in FEHBAR 1602.170-2.</p>

<p>(2) Effective January 1, 2013 all community rated plans must develop the FEHBP's rates using their State-filed rating methodology or, if not required to file with the State, their standard written and established rating methodology. A carrier who mandated by the State to use traditional community rating will be subject to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause. All other carriers will be subject to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this clause.</p>

<p>(i) The subscription rates agreed to in this contract shall meet the FEHB-specific MLR threshold as defined in FEHBAR 1602.170-14. The ratio of a plan's incurred claims, including the carrier's expenditures for activities that improve health care quality, to total premium revenue shall not be lower than the FEHB-specific MLR threshold published annually by OPM in its rate instructions.</p>

<p>(ii) The subscription rates agreed to in this contract shall be equivalent to the subscription rates given to the carrier's similarly sized subscriber group (SSSG) as defined in FEHBAR 1602.170-13. The subscription rates shall be determined according to the carrier's established policy, which must be applied consistently to the FEHBP and to the carrier's SSSG. If the SSSG receives a rate lower than that determined according to the carrier's established policy, it is considered a discount. The FEHBP must receive a discount equal to or greater than the carrier's SSSG discount.</p>

<p>(3) If subject to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, then:</p>

<p>(i) If, at the time of the rate reconciliation, the subscription rates are found to be lower than the equivalent rates for the SSSG, the carrier may include an adjustment to the Federal group's rates for the next contract period, except as noted in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this clause.</p>

<p>(ii) If, at the time of the rate reconciliation, the subscription rates are found to be higher than the equivalent rates for the SSSG, the carrier shall reimburse the Fund, for example, by reducing the FEHB rates for the next contract term to reflect the difference between the estimated rates and the rates which are derived using the methodology of the SSSG, except as noted in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this clause.</p>

<p>(iii) Carriers may provide additional guaranteed discounts to the FEHBP that are not given to the SSSG. Any such guaranteed discounts must be clearly identified as guaranteed discounts. After the beginning of the contract year for which the rates are set, these guaranteed FEHBP discounts may not be adjusted.</p>

<p>(4) If rates are determined by comparison with the FEHB-specific MLR threshold, then if the MLR for the carrier's FEHB plan is found to be lower than the published FEHB-specific MLR threshold, the carrier must pay a subsidization penalty equal to the difference into a subsidization penalty account.</p>

<p>(5) The following apply to community rated plans, regardless of the rating methodology:</p>

<p>(i) No upward adjustment in the rate established for this contract will be allowed or considered by the Government or will be made by the Carrier in this or in any other contract period on the basis of actual costs incurred, actual benefits provided, or actual size or composition of the FEHBP group during this contract period.</p>

<p>(ii) For contract years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, in the event this contract is not renewed, the final rate reconciliation will be performed. The carrier must promptly pay any amount owed to OPM. Any amount recoverable by the carrier is limited to the amount in the contingency reserve for the terminating plan as of December 31 of the terminating year.</p>

<p>(iii) Carriers may not impose surcharges (loadings not defined based on an established rating method) on the FEHBP subscription rates or use surcharges in the rate reconciliation process in any circumstance.</p>

<p>(6) For contract years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, in the event this contract is not renewed, the final rate reconciliation will be performed. The carrier must promptly pay any amount owed to OPM. Any amount recoverable by the carrier is limited to the amount in the contingency reserve for the terminating plan as of December 31 of the terminating year.</p>

<p>(7) Carriers may provide additional guaranteed discounts to the FEHBP. Any such guaranteed discounts must be clearly identified as guaranteed discounts. After the beginning of the contract year for which the rates are set, these guaranteed FEHBP discounts may not be adjusted.</p>

<p>(8) Carriers may not impose surcharges (loadings not defined based on an established rating method) on the FEHBP subscription rates or use surcharges in the rate reconciliation process. If the carrier is subject to the SSSG rules and imposes a surcharge on the SSSG, the carrier cannot impose the surcharge on FEHB.</p>

<p>Accounting and Allowable Cost (FEHBAR 1652.216–71) (JAN 2003) </p>

<p>(a) <i>Annual Accounting Statements.</i> (1) The Carrier shall furnish to OPM an accounting of its operations under the contract. In preparing the accounting, the Carrier shall follow the reporting requirements and statement formats prescribed by OPM in the OPM Annual and Fiscal Year Financial Reporting Instructions. </p>

<p>(2) The Carrier shall have its Annual Accounting Statements and that of its underwriter, if any, audited in accordance with the FEHBP Experienced-Rated Carrier and Service Organization Audit Guide (Guide). The Carrier shall submit the audit report and the Annual Accounting Statements to OPM in accordance with the requirements of the Guide. </p>

<p>(3) Based on the results of either the independent audit prescribed by the Guide or a Government audit, OPM may require the Carrier adjust its annual accounting statements (i) by amounts found not to constitute actual, allowable, allocable and reasonable costs; or (ii) to reflect prior overpayments or underpayments. </p>

<p>(4) The Carrier shall develop corrective action plans to resolve audit findings identified in audits that were performed in accordance with the Guide. The corrective action plans will be prepared in accordance with and as defined by the Guide. </p>

<p>(b) <i>Definition of costs.</i> (1) The Carrier may charge a cost to the contract for a contract term if the cost is actual, allowable, allocable, and reasonable. In addition, the Carrier must: </p>

<p>(i) on request, document and make available accounting support for the cost to justify that the cost is actual, reasonable and necessary; and</p>

<p>(ii) determine the cost in accordance with: (A) the terms of this contract, and (B) Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Subpart 1631.2 of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Acquisition Regulation (FEHBAR) applicable on the first day of the contract period. </p>

<p>(2) In the absence of specific contract terms to the contrary, the Carrier shall classify contract costs in accordance with the following criteria: </p>

<p>(i) <i>Benefits.</i> Benefit costs consist of payments made and liabilities incurred for covered health care services on behalf of FEHBP subscribers less any refunds, rebates, allowances or other credits received. </p>

<p>(ii) <i>Administrative expenses.</i> Administrative expenses consist of all actual, allowable, allocable and reasonable expenses incurred in the adjudication of subscriber benefit claims or incurred in the Carrier's overall operation of the business. Unless otherwise stated in the contract, administrative expenses include, in part: all taxes (excluding premium taxes, as provided in section 1631.205–41), insurance and reinsurance premiums, medical and dental consultants used in the adjudication process, concurrent or managed care review when not billed by a health care provider and other forms of utilization review, the cost of maintaining eligibility files, legal expenses incurred in the litigation of benefit payments and bank charges for letters of credit. Administrative expenses exclude the cost of Carrier personnel, equipment, and facilities directly used in the delivery of health care services, which are benefit costs, and the expense of managing the FEHBP investment program which is a reduction of investment income earned. </p>

<p>(iii) <i>Investment income.</i> While compliance with the checks presented letter of credit methodology will minimize funds on hand, the Carrier shall invest and reinvest all funds on hand, including any in the Special Reserve or any attributable to the reserve for incurred but unpaid claims, which are in excess of the funds needed to discharge promptly the obligations incurred under the contract. Investment income represents the net amount earned by the Carrier after deducting investment expenses. Investment expenses are those actual, allowable, allocable, and reasonable contract costs that are attributable to the investment of funds, such as consultant or management fees. </p>

<p>(iv) <i>Other charges.</i> (A) <i>Mandatory statutory reserve.</i> Charges for mandatory statutory reserves are not allowable unless specifically provided for in the contract. When the term “mandatory statutory reserve” is specifically identified as an allowable contract charge without further definition or explanation, it means a requirement imposed by State law upon the Carrier to set aside a specific amount or rate of funds into a restricted reserve that is accounted for separately from all other reserves and surpluses of the Carrier and which may be used only with the specific approval of the State official designated by law to make such approvals. The amount chargeable to the contract may not exceed an allocable portion of the amount actually set aside. If the statutory reserve is no longer required for the purpose for which it was created, and these funds become available for the general use of the Carrier, the Carrier shall return to the FEHBP a pro rata share based upon FEHBP's contribution to the total Carrier's set aside shall be returned to the FEHBP in accordance with FAR 31.201–5. </p>

<p>(B) <i>Premium taxes.</i> (1) When the term “premium taxes” is used in this contract without further definition or explanation, it means a tax, fee, or other monetary payment directly or indirectly imposed on FEHB premiums by any State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or by any political subdivision or other governmental authority of those entities, with the sole exception of a tax on net income or profit, if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity. </p>

<p>(2) For purposes of this paragraph (B), OPM has determined that the term “State” as used in 5 U.S.C. 8909(f) includes, but is not limited to, a territory or possession of the United States. </p>

<p>(c) <i>Certification of Accounting Statement Accuracy.</i> (1) The Carrier shall certify the annual and fiscal year accounting statements in the form set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this clause. The Carrier's chief executive officer and the chief financial officer shall sign the certificate. </p>

<p>(2) The Carrier shall require an authorized agent of its underwriter, if any, also to certify the annual accounting statement. </p>

<p>(3) The certificate required shall be in the following form: </p>

<p>Certification of Accounting Statement Accuracy </p>

<p>This is to certify that I have reviewed this accounting statement and to the best of my knowledge and belief: </p>

<p>1. The statement was prepared in conformity with the guidelines issued by the Office of Personnel Management and fairly presents the financial results of this reporting period in conformity with those guidelines. </p>

<p>Taxes—Foreign Negotiated Benefits Contracts (JAN 1998)</p>

<p>(a) To the extent that this contract provides for performing services outside the United States, its possessions, and Puerto Rico, this clause applies in lieu of any Federal, State, and local taxes clause of the contract.</p>

<p>(b) “Contract date,” as used in this clause, means the effective date of this contract or modification.</p>

<p>“Country concerned,” as used in this clause, means any country, other than the United States, its possessions, and Puerto Rico, in which expenditures under this contract are made. </p>

<p>“Tax” and “taxes,” as used in this clause, include fees and charges for doing business that are levied by the government of the country concerned or by its political subdivisions. </p>

<p>“All applicable taxes and duties,” as used in this clause, means all taxes and duties, in effect on the contract date, that the taxing authority is imposing and collecting on the transactions covered by this contract, pursuant to written ruling or regulation in effect on the contract date. </p>

<p>“After-imposed tax,” as used in this clause, means any new or increased tax or duty, or tax that was exempted or excluded on the contract date but whose exemption was later revoked or reduced during the contract period, other than excepted tax, on the transactions covered by this contract that the Carrier is required to pay or bear as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking effect after the contract date. </p>

<p>“After-relieved tax,” as used in this clause, means any amount of tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that would otherwise have been payable on the transactions covered by this contract, but which the Carrier is not required to pay or bear, or for which the Carrier obtains a refund, as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking effect after the contract date. </p>

<p>“Excepted tax,” as used in this clause, means social security or other employment taxes, net income and franchise taxes, excess profits taxes, capital stock taxes, transportation taxes, unemployment compensation taxes, and property taxes. “Excepted tax” does not include gross income taxes levied on or measured by sales or receipts from sales covered by this contract, or any tax assessed on the Carrier's possession of, interest in, or use of property, title to which is in the U.S. Government. </p>

<p>(c) Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all applicable taxes and duties, except taxes and duties that the Government of the United States and the government of the country concerned have agreed shall not be applicable to expenditures in such country by or on behalf of the United States. </p>

<p>(d) The contract price shall be increased by the amount of any after-imposed tax or of any tax or duty specifically excluded from the contract price by a provision of this contract that the Carrier is required to pay or bear, including any interest or penalty, if the Carrier states in writing that the contract price does not include any contingency for such tax and if liability for such tax, interest, or penalty was not incurred through the Carrier's fault, negligence, or failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply with the provisions of paragraph (i) below. </p>

<p>(e) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any after-relieved tax, including any interest or penalty. The Government of the United States shall be entitled to interest received by the Carrier incident to a refund of taxes to the extent that such interest was earned after the Carrier was paid by the Government of the United States for such taxes. The Government of the United States shall be entitled to repayment of any penalty refunded to the Carrier to the extent that the penalty was paid by the Government. </p>

<p>(f) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that was included in the contract and that the Carrier is required to pay or bear, or does not obtain a refund of, through the Carrier's fault, negligence, or failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply with the provisions of paragraph (i) below. </p>

<p>(g) No adjustment shall be made in the contract price under this clause unless the amount of the adjustment exceeds $250. </p>

<p>(h) If the Carrier obtains a reduction in tax liability under the United States Internal Revenue Code (Title 26, U.S. Code) because of the payment of any tax or duty that either was included in the contract price or was the basis of an increase in the contract price, the amount of the reduction shall be paid or credited to the Government of the United States as the Contracting Officer directs. </p>

<p>(i) The Carrier shall take all reasonable action to obtain exemption from or refund of any taxes or duties, including interest or penalty, from which the United States Government, the Carrier, any subcontractor, or the transactions covered by this contract are exempt under the laws of the country concerned or its political subdivisions or which the governments of the United States and of the country concerned have agreed shall not be applicable to expenditures in such country by or on behalf of the United States. </p>

<p>(j) The Carrier shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of all matters relating to taxes or duties that reasonably may be expected to result in either an increase or decrease in the contract price and shall take appropriate action as the Contracting Officer directs. The contract price shall be equitably adjusted to cover the costs of action taken by the Carrier at the direction of the Contracting Officer, including any interest, penalty, and reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>

<p>Subcontracts (JUL 2005)</p>

<p>(a) The carrier will notify the Contracting officer in writing at least 30 days in advance of entering into any subcontract or subcontract modification, or as otherwise specified by this contract, if the amount of the subcontract or modification charged to the FEHB Program equals or exceeds $550,000 and is at least 25 percent of the total subcontract cost. The amount of the dollar charge to the FEHB Program shall be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 254b(a)(7). Failure to provide advance notice may result in a Contracting officer's disallowance of subcontract costs or a penalty in the performance aspect of the carrier's service charge. In determining whether the amount chargeable to the FEHB Program contract for a given subcontract or modification equals or exceeds the $550,000 threshold, the following rules apply:</p>

<p>(1) For initial advance notification, the carrier shall add the total cost/price for the base year and all options, including quantity or service options and option periods.</p>

<p>(2) For contract modifications, options and/or renewals (<i>e.g.</i> evergreen contracts) not accounted for in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause, the carrier shall provide advance notification if they cause the total price to equal or exceed the threshold. OPM's review will be of the modification(s), itself, but documentation for the original subcontract will be required to perform the review. The $550,000 threshold will be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act. All subcontracts or subcontract modifications that equal or exceed the threshold are subject to audit under FAR 52.215–2 “Audit and Records—Negotiations” if based on cost analysis or 48 CFR 1646.301 and 1552.246–70 “FEHB Inspection” if based on price analysis.</p>

<p>(b) The advance notification required by paragraph (a) of this clause will include the information specified below:</p>

<p>(1) A description of the supplies or services to be subcontracted;</p>

<p>(2) Identification of the type of subcontract to be used;</p>

<p>(3) Identification of the proposed subcontractor and an explanation of why and how the proposed subcontractor was selected, including the competition obtained;</p>

<p>(4) The proposed subcontract price and the carrier's cost or price analysis;</p>

<p>(5) The subcontractor's current, complete, and accurate cost or pricing data and a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data must be submitted to the Contracting officer if required by law, regulation, or other contract provisions.</p>

<p>(6) [Reserved]</p>

<p>(7) A negotiation memorandum reflecting—</p>

<p>(i) The principal elements of the subcontract price negotiations;</p>

<p>(ii) The most significant consideration controlling establishment of initial or revised prices;</p>

<p>(iii) An explanation of the reason cost or pricing data are not required, if the carrier believes that cost or pricing data are not required.</p>

<p>(iv) The extent, if any, to which the carrier did not rely on the subcontractor's cost or pricing data in determining the price objective and in negotiating the final price;</p>

<p>(v) The extent, if any, to which it was recognized in the negotiation that the subcontractor's cost or pricing data were not accurate, complete, or current; the action taken by the carrier and the subcontractor; and the effect of any such defective data on the total price negotiated;</p>

<p>(vi) The reasons for any significant difference between the carrier's price objective and the price negotiated; and</p>

<p>(vii) A complete explanation of the incentive fee or profit plan, when incentives are used. The explanation will identify each critical performance element, management decisions used to quantify each incentive element, reasons for the incentives, and a summary of all trade-off possibilities considered.</p>

<p>(c) The carrier will obtain the Contracting officer's written consent before placing any subcontract for which advance notification is required under paragraph (a) of this clause. However, the Contracting officer may ratify in writing any such subcontract for which written consent was not obtained. Ratification will constitute the consent of the Contracting officer.</p>

<p>(d) The Contracting officer may waive the requirement for advance notification and consent required by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this clause where the carrier and subcontractor submit an application or renewal as a contractor team arrangement as defined in FAR Subpart 9.6 and—</p>

<p>(1) The Contracting officer evaluated the arrangement during negotiation of the contract or contract renewal; and</p>

<p>(2) The subcontractor's price and/or costs were included in the Plan's rates that were reviewed and approved by the Contracting officer during negotiation of the contract or contract renewal.</p>

<p>(e) If the carrier follows the notification and consent requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this clause and subsequently obtains the Contracting officer's consent or ratification, then the reasonableness of the subcontract's costs will be inferred as provided for in 1631.205–81. However, consent or ratification by the Contracting officer will not constitute a determination:</p>

<p>(1) Of the acceptability of any subcontract terms or conditions;</p>

<p>(2) Of the allowability of any cost under this contract; or</p>

<p>(3) That the carrier should be relieved of any responsibility for performing this contract.</p>

<p>(f) No subcontract placed under this contract will provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis. Any fee payable under cost reimbursement type subcontracts will not exceed the fee limitations in FAR 15.404–4(c)(4)(i). Any profit or fee payable under a subcontract will be in accordance with the provision of Section 3.7, <i>Service Charge.</i></p>

<p>(g) The carrier will give the Contracting officer immediate written notice of any action or suit filed and prompt notice of any claim made against the carrier by any subcontractor or vendor that, in the opinion of the carrier, may result in litigation related in any way to this contract with respect to which the carrier may be entitled to reimbursement from the Government.</p>

<p>Government Property (Negotiated Benefits Contracts) (JAN 1998) </p>

<p>(a) Government-furnished property. (1) The Government shall deliver to the Carrier, for use in connection with and under the terms of this contract, the Government-furnished property described in this contract together with any related data and information that the Carrier may request and is reasonably required for the intended use of the property (hereinafter referred to as “Government-furnished property”). </p>

<p>(2) The delivery or performance dates for this contract are based upon the expectation that Government-furnished property suitable for use (except for property furnished “as-is”) will be delivered to the Carrier at the times stated in this contract or, if not so stated, in sufficient time to enable the Carrier to meet the contract's performance dates. </p>

<p>(3) If Government-furnished property is received by the Carrier in a condition not suitable for the intended use, the Carrier shall, upon receipt of it, notify the Contracting Officer, detailing the facts, and, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at Government expense, either repair, modify, return, or otherwise dispose of the property. After completing the directed action and upon written request of the Carrier, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment as provided in paragraph (h) of this clause. </p>

<p>(b) Changes in Government-furnished property. (1) The Contracting Officer may, by written notice, (i) decrease the Government-furnished property provided or to be provided under this contract, or (ii) substitute other Government-furnished property for the property to be provided by the Government, or to be acquired by the Carrier for the Government, under this contract. The Carrier shall promptly take such action as the Contracting Officer may direct regarding the removal, shipment, or disposal of the property covered by such notice. </p>

<p>(2) Upon the Carrier's written request, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment to the contract in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause, if the Government has agreed in this contract to make the property available for performing this contract and there is any—</p>

<p>(i) Decrease or substitution in this property pursuant to subparagraph (b)(1) above; or </p>

<p>(ii) Withdrawal of authority to use this property, if provided under any other contract or lease. </p>

<p>(c) Title in Government property. (1) The Government shall retain title to all Government-furnished property. </p>

<p>(2) All Government-furnished property and all property acquired by the Carrier, title to which vests in the Government under this paragraph (collectively referred to as “Government property”), are subject to the provisions of this clause. Title to Government property shall not be affected by its incorporation into or attachment to any property not owned by the Government, nor shall Government property become a fixture or lose its identity as personal property by being attached to any real property. </p>

<p>(d) Use of Government property. The Government property shall be used only for performing this contract, unless otherwise provided in this contract or approved by the Contracting Officer. </p>

<p>(e) Property administration. (1) The Carrier shall be responsible and accountable for all Government property provided under this contract and shall comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 45.5, as in effect on the date of this contract. </p>

<p>(2) The Carrier shall establish and maintain a program for the use, maintenance, repair, protection, and preservation of Government property in accordance with sound industrial practice and the applicable provisions of subpart 45.5 of the FAR. </p>

<p>(3) If damage occurs to Government property, the risk of which has been assumed by the Government under this contract, the Government shall replace the items or the Carrier shall make such repairs as the Government directs. However, if the Carrier cannot effect such repairs within the time required, the Carrier shall dispose of the property as directed by the Contracting Officer. When any property for which the Government is responsible is replaced or repaired, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause. </p>

<p>(4) The Carrier represents that the contract price does not include any amount for repairs or replacement for which the Government is responsible. Repair or replacement of property for which the Carrier is responsible shall be accomplished by the Carrier at its own expense. </p>

<p>(f) Access. The Government and all its designees shall have access at all reasonable times to the premises in which any Government property is located for the purpose of inspecting the Government property. </p>

<p>(g) Risk of loss. Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the Carrier assumes the risk of, and shall be responsible for, any loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government property upon its delivery to the Carrier. However, the Carrier is not responsible for reasonable wear and tear to Government property or for Government property properly consumed in performing this contract. </p>

<p>(h) Equitable adjustment. When this clause specifies an equitable adjustment, it shall be made to any affected contract provision in accordance with the procedures of the Changes clause. When appropriate, the Contracting Officer may initiate an equitable adjustment in favor of the Government. The right to an equitable adjustment shall be the Carrier's exclusive remedy. The Government shall not be liable to suit for breach of contract for— </p>

<p>(1) Any delay in delivery of Government-furnished property; </p>

<p>(2) Delivery of Government-furnished property in a condition not suitable for its intended use; </p>

<p>(3) A decrease in or substitution of Government-furnished property; or </p>

<p>(4) Failure to repair or replace Government property for which the Government is responsible. </p>

<p>(i) Final accounting and disposition of Government property. Upon completing this contract, or at such earlier dates as may be fixed by the Contracting Officer, the Carrier shall submit, in a form acceptable to the Contracting Officer, inventory schedules covering all items of Government property (including any resulting scrap) not consumed in performing this contract or delivered to the Government. The Carrier shall prepare for shipment, deliver f.o.b. origin, or dispose of the Government property as may be directed or authorized by the Contracting Officer. The net proceeds of any such disposal shall be credited to the contract price or shall be paid to the Government as the Contracting Officer directs. </p>

<p>(j) Abandonment and restoration of Carrier's premises. Unless otherwise provided herein, the Government—</p>

<p>(1) May abandon any Government property in place, at which time all obligations of the Government regarding such abandoned property shall cease; and </p>

<p>(2) Has no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the Carrier's premises under any circumstances (e.g., abandonment, disposition upon completion of need, or upon contract completion). However, if the Government-furnished property is withdrawn or is unsuitable for the intended use, or if other Government property is substituted, then the equitable adjustment under paragraph (h) of this clause may properly include restoration or rehabilitation costs. </p>

<p>(k) Communications. All communications under this clause shall be in writing. </p>

<p>(l) Overseas contracts. If this contract is to be performed outside of the United States of America, its territories, or possessions, the words “Government” and “Government-furnished” (wherever they appear in this clause) shall be construed as “United States Government” and “United States Government-furnished”, respectively.</p>

<p>FEHBP Termination for Convenience of the Government—Negotiated Benefits Contracts (JAN 1998) </p>

<p>(a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this contract in whole or, from time to time, in part if the Contracting Officer determines that a termination is in the Government's interest. The Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the Carrier a Notice of Termination specifying the extent of terminating and the effective date. </p>

<p>(b) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Carrier shall immediately proceed with the following obligations, regardless of any delay in determining or adjusting any amounts due under this clause: </p>

<p>(1) Stop work as specified in the notice. </p>

<p>(6) As directed by the Contracting Officer, deliver to the Government any data, reports, or studies that, if the contract had been completed, would be required to be furnished to the Government. </p>

<p>(7) Complete performance of the work not terminated. </p>

<p>(c) After termination, the Carrier shall submit a final termination settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form and with the certification prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The Carrier shall submit the proposal promptly, but no later than 1 year from the effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer upon written request of the Carrier within this 1-year period. However, if the Contracting Officer determines that the facts justify it, a termination settlement proposal may be received and acted on after 1 year or any extension. If the Carrier fails to submit the proposal within the time allowed, the Contracting Officer may determine, on the basis of information available, the amount, if any, due the Carrier because of the termination and shall pay the amount determined. </p>

<p>(d) Subject to paragraph (c) of this clause, the Carrier and the Contracting Officer may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount to be paid or remaining to be paid because of the termination. The amount may include a reasonable allowance for profit on work done. However, the agreed amount, whether under this paragraph (d) or paragraph (e) of this clause, exclusive of costs shown in subparagraph (e)(3) of this clause, may not exceed the total contract price as reduced by (1) the amount of payments previously made and (2) the contract price of work not terminated. The contract shall be modified, and the Carrier paid the agreed amount. Paragraph (e) of this clause shall not limit, restrict, or affect the amount that may be agreed upon to be paid under this paragraph. </p>

<p>(e) If the Carrier and the Contracting Officer fail to agree on the whole amount to be paid because of the termination of work, the Contracting Officer shall pay the Carrier the amounts determined by the Contracting Officer as follows, but without duplication of any amounts agreed on under paragraph (d) above: </p>

<p>(1) The contract price for completed services accepted by the Government not previously paid for. </p>

<p>(2) The total of— </p>

<p>(i) The costs incurred in the performance of the work terminated, including initial costs and preparatory expense allocable thereto, but excluding any costs attributable to services paid or to be paid under paragraph (e)(1) of this clause; </p>

<p>(ii) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement proposals under terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to the terminated portion of the contract if not included in subdivision (e)(2)(i) of this clause; and </p>

<p>(iii) A sum, as profit on subdivision (e)(2)(i) of this clause, determined by the Contracting Officer under 49.202 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, to be fair and reasonable. </p>

<p>(3) The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, including— </p>

<p>(i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably necessary for the preparation of termination settlement proposals and supporting data; </p>

<p>(ii) The termination and settlement of subcontracts (excluding the amounts of such settlements); and </p>

<p>(f) The cost principles and procedures of part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, shall govern all costs claimed, agreed to, or determined under this clause. </p>

<p>(g) The Carrier shall have the right of appeal, under the Disputes clause, from any determination made by the Contracting Officer under paragraph (c), (e), or (i) of this clause, except that if the Carrier failed to submit the termination settlement proposal or request for equitable adjustment within the time provided in paragraph (c) or (i), respectively, and failed to request a time extension, there is no right of appeal. </p>

<p>(h) In arriving at the amount due the Carrier under this clause, there shall be deducted— </p>

<p>(1) All unliquidated advance or other payments to the Carrier under the terminated portion of this contract; </p>

<p>(2) Any claim which the Government has against the Carrier under this contract; and </p>

<p>(i) If the termination is partial, the Carrier may file a proposal with the Contracting Officer for an equitable adjustment of the price(s) of the continued portion of the contract. The Contracting Officer shall make any equitable adjustment agreed upon. Any proposal by the Carrier for an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be requested within 90 days from the effective date of termination unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer. </p>

<p>(j)(1) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it prescribes, make partial payments and payments against costs incurred by the Carrier for the terminated portion of the contract, if the Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed the amount to which the Carrier will be entitled. </p>

<p>(2) If the total payments exceed the amount finally determined to be due, the Carrier shall repay the excess to the Government upon demand, together with interest computed at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under 50 U.S.C. App. 1215(b)(2). Interest shall be computed for the period from the date the excess payment is received by the Carrier to the date the excess is repaid. </p>

<p>(k) Unless otherwise provided in this contract or by statute, the Carrier shall maintain all records and documents relating to the terminated portion of this contract for 3 years after final settlement. This includes all books and other evidence bearing on the Carrier's costs and expenses under this contract. The Carrier shall make these records and documents available to the Government, at the Carrier's office, at all reasonable times, without any direct charge. If approved by the Contracting Officer, photographs, microphotographs, or other authentic reproductions may be maintained instead of original records and documents.</p>

<p>FEHBP Termination for Default—Negotiated Benefits Contracts (JAN 1998) </p>

<p>(a) (1) The Government may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of default to the Carrier, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Carrier fails to— </p>

<p>(i) Perform the services within the time specified in this contract or any extension; </p>

<p>(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below); or </p>

<p>(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below). </p>

<p>(2) The Government's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Carrier does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of the notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure. </p>

<p>(b) If the Government terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or service similar to those terminated, and the Carrier will be liable to the Government for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However, the Carrier shall continue the work not terminated. </p>

<p>(c) Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier, the Carrier shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Carrier. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and (9) unusually severe weather. In each instance the failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Carrier. </p>

<p>(d) If the failure to perform is caused by the default of a subcontractor at any tier, and if the cause of the default is beyond the control of both the Carrier and subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of either, the Carrier shall not be liable for any excess costs for failure to perform, unless the subcontracted supplies or services were obtainable from other sources in sufficient time for the Carrier to meet the required delivery schedule. </p>

<p>(e) If this contract is terminated for default, the Government may require the Carrier to transfer title and deliver to the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer, any completed or partially completed information and contract rights that the Carrier has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. </p>

<p>(f) If, after termination, it is determined that the Carrier was not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for the convenience of the Government. </p>

<p>(g) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
