procedures for handling requests made by interested parties for
an independent review of their protest at a level above the contracting
officer. In addition, for purposes of this paragraph, a “level above the
contracting officer” means the CCO or, if the CCO is less than two

appropriate official at a comparable or higher level.</p>
