Methods of evaluation which assign a point score to cost or price

evaluation of technical and other factors but are not needed in
evaluating cost or price and tend to obscure the tradeoff between cost/price
and other factors, rather than clarifying it. If point scoring of
cost/price is utilized, it should be demonstrated that the value
of a cost/price point is comparable, in value to the Government,
to the value of a non-cost/price point. When a cost realism analysis
is performed, the resulting realistic cost estimate should be used
in the evaluation of cost, except when using a firm-fixed-price

Business clearance.</span>
         </p>
         <p class="p List1">(a) Generally, pre-negotiation and post-negotiation
business clearances are required for each negotiated contract action.
Business clearance memoranda (BCM) document the basis for approval
of the action, and the basis for determination that the negotiated
prices are fair and reasonable.
(b) For competitive acquisitions, the pre-BCM presents a chronology
of the acquisition up to the determination of competitive range
and provides the basis for the competitive range decision. The post-BCM
continues the chronology to contract award and provides the basis
for the award decision. If award is made without discussions, on
the basis of original offers, the pre- and post-BCM may be combined. 
(c) For contracts and modifications requiring price negotiations,
the pre-BCM demonstrates to the approving official that the Government
is ready to enter into negotiations. It addresses salient legal
and regulatory requirements and sets forth the Government s negotiation
objectives. It generally includes a discussion of the bases for
the contractor s proposal and the Government objective, DCAA and
other Government pricing recommendations and the analysis done and
conclusions reached by the negotiating team. The post-BCM describes
the results of negotiations, and documents the basis for determining
the negotiated price is fair and reasonable. Using the objective
in the pre-BCM as a base, it addresses the reasons for any difference
between the initial objective and the final negotiated amount. The
pre- and post- BCM together constitute the documentation required
by FAR 15.406-3 and DFARS 215.406-3 and should provide all the information
required therein. In particular, the BCMs should document the use
made of field pricing assistance and describe the extent of Government
reliance on the contractor s certified cost or pricing data, if
obtained, in sufficient detail to provide a basis for Government
recovery in the event any of the data proves inaccurate, incomplete
or not current. </p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Annex 2, Business Clearance Memorandum,
contains the required content and recommended format to document
decisions on contract actions that are subject to business clearance
requirements. If an activity plans to use a format other than Annex
2, the activity shall notify DASN(AP) by submitting its HCA approved
alternate format by email at <span class="ph Hyperlink">RDAJ&amp;As.fct@navy.mil</span> with the
subject [Activity Name] NMCARS 5201.690 Alternate Business Clearance Memorandum
