should be coordinated with the PPMAP review team leader. For reviews
under 5201.691-2, the Director, OSBP, will designate SBP review
team members. Associate Directors of Small Business are responsible
for implementation of the PPMAP review SBP segment of their field
contracting activities including designating PPMAP review SBP team
members and monitoring compliance with their recommendations. Team

develop the zero goal, the past performance of the offeror on similar
requirements, and the current procedures used by the offeror to maximize
opportunities for small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled
veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged
business and women-owned small business concerns to participate
in its subcontracting program. The contracting officer shall consider
the CAO s findings, including any recommendations, prior to approval
of the subcontracting plan. The contract file shall be documented to reflect the review and the contracting
officer's final decision relative to an acceptable goal. If the
contracting officer determines that a subcontracting plan containing
a zero goal is appropriate, the determination shall be approved
at a level above the contracting officer and placed in the contract file.</p>
