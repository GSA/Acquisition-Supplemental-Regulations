         <p class="p List2">4. Identification of Statutory Authority.</p>
         <p class="p List2">10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5), as implemented by
FAR 6.302-5: Authorized or Required by Statute.</p>
         <p class="p List2">15 U.S.C. 638(r)(1) states:</p>
         <p class="p List2">In the case of a small business concern
that is awarded a funding agreement for Phase II of an SBIR or STTR
program, a Federal agency may enter into a Phase III agreement with
that business concern for additional work to be performed during
or after the Phase II period.</p>
         <p class="p List2">Furthermore, 15 U.S.C. 638(r)(4) states:</p>
         <p class="p List2">To the greatest extent practicable, Federal
agencies and Federal prime contractors shall issue Phase III awards
relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR
and STTR award recipients that developed the technology.</p>
         <p class="p List2">5. Demonstration that Proposed Contractor
s Unique Qualifications or Nature of Acquisition Requires Use of
Authority Cited.</p>
         <p class="p List2">The nature of the acquisition requires
the use of the authority cited. The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured
in three phases. Phase I (project feasibility) determines the scientific,
technical and commercial merit and feasibility of the ideas submitted.
Phase II (project development to prototype) is the major research
and development effort, funding the prototyping and demonstration
of the most promising Phase I projects. Phase III (commercialization)
is the ultimate goal of the SBIR/STTR Programs. Because the Phase
III work derives from, extends, or completes efforts performed under Phase
I and Phase II, use of the authority cited is required.</p>
         <p class="p List2">6. Description of Efforts Made to Ensure
Offerors Were Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as Practicable/
Public Notification through Government Point of Entry (GPE).</p>
         <p class="p List2">As described above, only ___<strong class="ph b">[insert
name of contractor]</strong>___ is being considered for Phase III award
due to the nature of the acquisition. In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(7),
this proposed contract action does not require public notification to
the GPE.</p>
         <p class="p List2">7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable
Cost.</p>
         <p class="p List2">The Contracting Officer will determine
prior to award that the negotiated price of the contract executed
under this justification is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR
Subpart 15.4. This determination will be documented in ___<strong class="ph b">[list
applicable location of the determination, e.g. Business Clearance
Memorandum]</strong>___, which will be included in the contract file.</p>
         <p class="p List2">8. Description of Market Research or Statement
of the Reason Market Research was not Conducted.</p>
         <p class="p List2">FAR 10.001(a)(2) indicates that market
research appropriate to the circumstances must be conducted. SBIR
Phase III procurements are such that traditional market research
to identify alternative sources is generally unnecessary. As described
above, the Phase III work derives from, extends, or completes efforts
performed under Phase I and Phase II.</p>

Contracting Officer is not aware of any specific actions that would
further remove barriers to competition.</p>
