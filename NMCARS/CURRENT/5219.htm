            segment. PPMAP review SBP segments should be coordinated with the PPMAP review team
            leader. For reviews under 5201.691-2, the Director, OSBP, will designate SBP review team
            members. Associate Directors of Small Business are responsible for implementation of the
            PPMAP review SBP segment of their field contracting activities including designating
            PPMAP review SBP team members and monitoring compliance with their recommendations. Team
            members should generally be Deputies for Small Business from other than the activity
            under review. Associate Directors of Small Business are responsible for providing a copy
            of the PPMAP review SBP segment report(s) to the Director, OSBP.</p>
