        </span>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">4. Identification of Statutory Authority. </p>
         <p class="p List2">10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5), as implemented by FAR 6.302-5:
        Authorized or Required by Statute.</p>
         <p class="p List2">15 U.S.C. 638(r)(1) states:</p>
         <p class="p List2">In the case of a small business concern that is
        awarded a funding agreement for Phase II of an SBIR or STTR program, a Federal agency may
        enter into a Phase III agreement with that business concern for additional work to be
        performed during or after the Phase II period. </p>
         <p class="p List2">Furthermore, 15 U.S.C. 638(r)(4) states:</p>
         <p class="p List2">To the greatest extent practicable, Federal agencies
        and Federal prime contractors shall issue Phase III awards relating to technology, including
        sole source awards, to the SBIR and STTR award recipients that developed the technology. </p>
         <p class="p List2">5. Demonstration that Proposed Contractor s Unique
        Qualifications or Nature of Acquisition Requires Use of Authority Cited. </p>
         <p class="p List2">The nature of the acquisition requires the use of
        the authority cited. The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured in three phases. Phase I (project
        feasibility) determines the scientific, technical and commercial merit and feasibility of
        the ideas submitted. Phase II (project development to prototype) is the major research and
        development effort, funding the prototyping and demonstration of the most promising Phase I
        projects. Phase III (commercialization) is the ultimate goal of the SBIR/STTR Programs.
        Because the Phase III work derives from, extends, or completes efforts performed under Phase
        I and Phase II, use of the authority cited is required. </p>
         <p class="p List2">6. Description of Efforts Made to Ensure Offerors
        Were Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as Practicable/ Public Notification through
        Government Point of Entry (GPE). </p>
         <p class="p List2">As described above, only ___<strong class="ph b">[insert name of contractor]</strong>___ is being considered for
        Phase III award due to the nature of the acquisition. In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(7),
        this proposed contract action does not require public notification to the GPE.</p>
         <p class="p List2">7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost. </p>
         <p class="p List2">The Contracting Officer will determine prior to
        award that the negotiated price of the contract executed under this justification is fair
        and reasonable pursuant to FAR Subpart 15.4. This determination will be documented in ___<strong class="ph b">[list applicable location of the determination, e.g. Business
          Clearance Memorandum]</strong>___, which will be included in the contract file.</p>
         <p class="p List2">8. Description of Market Research or Statement of
        the Reason Market Research was not Conducted.</p>
         <p class="p List2">FAR 10.001(a)(2) indicates that market research
        appropriate to the circumstances must be conducted. SBIR Phase III procurements are such
        that traditional market research to identify alternative sources is generally unnecessary.
        As described above, the Phase III work derives from, extends, or completes efforts performed
        under Phase I and Phase II.</p>
         <p class="p List2">
            <span class="ph BoldItalic">NOTE (delete after reading): Notwithstanding the statement above, market research may be
          performed if appropriate. If any market research was performed, describe in this section.

         <p class="p List2">Not applicable.</p>
         <p class="p List2">11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Future
        Competition. </p>
         <p class="p List2">The Contracting Officer anticipates that competitors
        will enter the market once the product is commercialized. It is likely that future
        acquisitions will be competed using full and open competition and commercial item
        acquisition procedures. The Contracting Officer is not aware of any specific actions that
        would further remove barriers to competition.</p>
         <p class="p List2">12. Period of Performance. </p>
         <p class="p List2">Base: ___<strong class="ph b">[insert
          length of base period of performance]</strong>___</p>
         <p class="p List2">Option(s): ___<strong class="ph b">[insert
          the length of any option periods of performance (if any)]</strong>___.</p>
         <p class="p List2">13. Total Estimated Dollar Value of the Acquisition
        Covered by this J&amp;A, with Funding Specified by Year and Appropriation. </p>
         <p class="p List2">The total estimated value of this acquisition is
          ___<strong class="ph b">[insert total estimated value]</strong>___. ___<strong class="ph b">[insert type of funding, e.g. RDT&amp;E ]</strong>___ funding is
        anticipated to be allocated as follows: </p>

          allocation of funding by year and appropriation]</strong>___.</p>
         <p class="p List2">14. Actions Attempted to Make Immediate Acquisition
        Competitive and Cost/Benefit Analysis</p>
         <p class="p List2">No actions were attempted to make the immediate
        acquisition competitive; no cost/benefit analysis was performed. As described above, only
          ___<strong class="ph b">[insert name of contractor]</strong>___ is being considered
        for Phase III award due to the nature of the acquisition.</p>
         <p class="p List2">
            <span class="ph BoldItalic">NOTE (delete after reading): The following section may need to be revised. This template
          assumes that the total anticipated value of the action (base plus all options) is within
          the thresholds described in FAR 6.304(a)(2). The appropriate approval authorities for your
          action may be different than this template. See FAR 6.304, DFARS 206.304, NMCARS 5206.304,
