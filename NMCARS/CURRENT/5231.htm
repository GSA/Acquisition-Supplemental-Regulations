         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Scope and
                authority</em>. Where it would facilitate the achievement of the policy objectives
              set forth in 10 U.S.C. 2501(b), the Navy may enter into a shipbuilding capability
              preservation agreement with a contractor. As authorized by Section 1027 of the
              National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 1998 (P.L. 105-85), such an agreement
              permits the contractor to claim certain indirect costs attributable to its private
              sector work as allowable costs on Navy shipbuilding contracts.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Definition</em>. Incremental indirect cost, as used in this subsection, means an
              additional indirect cost that results from performing private sector work described in
              a shipbuilding capability preservation agreement.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Purpose and
                guidelines</em>. The purpose of a shipbuilding capability preservation agreement is
              to broaden and strengthen the shipbuilding industrial base by providing an incentive
              for a shipbuilder to obtain new private sector work, thereby reducing the Navy's cost
              of doing business. The Navy will use the following guidelines to evaluate requests for
              shipbuilding capability preservation agreements:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) ASN(RDA) must make a determination that an
              agreement would facilitate the achievement of the policy objectives set forth in 10
              U.S.C. 2501(b). The primary consideration in making this determination is whether an
              agreement would promote future growth in the amount of private sector work that a
              shipbuilder is able to obtain.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) An agreement generally will be considered
              only for a shipbuilder with little or no private sector work.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The agreement shall apply to prospective
              private sector work only and shall not extend beyond 5 years.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The agreement must project an overall
              benefit to the Navy, including net savings. This would be achieved by demonstrating
              that private sector work will absorb costs that otherwise would be absorbed by the
              Navy.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Cost-reimbursement rules</em>. If the Navy enters into a shipbuilding capability
              preservation agreement with a contractor, the following cost-reimbursement rules
              apply:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The agreement shall require the contractor
              to allocate the following costs to private sector work:</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The direct costs attributable to the
              private sector work;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The incremental indirect costs
              attributable to the private sector work; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) The non-incremental indirect costs to
              the extent that the revenue attributable to the private sector work exceeds the sum of
              the costs specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this subsection.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The agreement shall require that the sum
              of the costs specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(1)(iii) of this subsection not
              exceed the amount of indirect costs that would have been allocated to the private
              sector work in accordance with the contractor's established accounting practices.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The Navy may agree to modify the amount
              calculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this subsection if it determines
              that a modification is appropriate to the particular situation. In so doing, the Navy
              may agree to the allocation of a smaller or larger portion of the amount calculated in
              accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this subsection, to private sector work.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Any smaller amount shall not be less than
              the sum of the costs specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this
              subsection.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Any larger amount shall not exceed the
              sum of the costs specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this subsection and the amount of
              indirect costs that would have been allocated to the private sector work in accordance
              with the contractor's established accounting practices.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) In determining whether such a
              modification is appropriate, the Navy will consider factors such as the impact of
              pre-existing firm-fixed-price Navy contracts on the amount of costs that would be
              reimbursed by the Navy, the impact of pre-existing private sector work on the cost
              benefit that would be received by the contractor, and the extent to which allocating a
              smaller or larger portion of costs to private sector work would provide a sufficient
              incentive for the contractor to obtain additional private sector work.</p>
         <p class="p List1" id="d1e3000__i1020629">(e) <em class="ph i">Procedure</em>. A contractor may submit a request for a
              shipbuilding capability preservation agreement, together with appropriate
              justification, through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Ships, to
              ASN(RDA), who has approval or disapproval authority. The contractor should also
              provide an informational copy of any such request to the cognizant administrative
              contracting officer.</p>
