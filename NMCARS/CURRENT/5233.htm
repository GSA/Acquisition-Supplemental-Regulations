            under DON contracts to the ASBCA. Because of the frequent complexity of these cases, the
            OGC and the contracting activity involved should maintain the continuity of any DON
            claim team that might have investigated and evaluated the contractor's claim submission.
            Such teams should continue to function in an assisting capacity under the leadership of
            the OGC Trial Attorney assigned to handle the appeal.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Litigation
              report requirement</em>. With the compilation of Rule 4 documents, a comprehensive
            litigation report shall be forwarded to the Litigation Division. The report should
            include:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) A detailed narrative statement of facts,
            preferably in chronological sequence, and with a topical segregation when appropriate,
            with references to attached supporting documents of expected testimony. If such a
            statement was previously submitted, it need not be submitted a second time, but should
            be supplemented or revised if additional information becomes available in the
            interim.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) An analysis and evaluation (classified as
            attorney client privileged information) of the factual and legal positions of both sides
            (including affirmative defenses and counterclaims available to the Government), the
            available evidence, and the expertise and effectiveness of prospective witnesses.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The advisory report, if any, of the
            reviewing official or board.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Settlement
              negotiations pending appeal</em>. The conduct of settlement negotiations in connection
            with any pending appeal should generally be accomplished by a selected team consisting
            of the trial attorney and representatives of the contracting officer (including
            contracting activity technical personnel, counsel, negotiator, and auditor if
            necessary). Other arrangements may be made in specific cases as appropriate. However, no
            final settlement agreement will be made without the written approval of the contracting
            officer. When a settlement is made, a memorandum shall be prepared by the negotiating
            team (and signed by all team members) stating the basis and reasons. The settlement
            agreement shall be drafted by the contracting activity and trial attorney. The trial
            attorney shall file any legal papers required to be filed with the ASBCA to effect
            disposition of the case by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Review and
              approval</em>. Negotiated settlements of appeals pending before the ASBCA, as well as
            negotiated settlements of appeal issues that have been remanded to the DON for quantum
            determination, will be subject to review and approval at levels established for claims
            of the same dollar amount.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Contract
              modification</em>. Whenever contract modification and other contract documents are
            required to implement a settlement of ASBCA or appellate court decision, they should
            reference the ASBCA proceedings by title and docket number.</p>
