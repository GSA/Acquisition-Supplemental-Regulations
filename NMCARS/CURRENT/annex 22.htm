         <p class="p Body">This category consists of supporting the application
        of engineering disciplines to technically support the research and development of new and
        existing Naval capabilities and systems, technically support development of significant
        alterations to existing systems, support integration and interface of existing equipment or
        software into different applications or platforms to support the warfighter, and support
        evaluation of foreign or non-developmental systems, equipment, and technologies. This
        category also includes all support required within the area of environmental engineering of
        U. S. Navy weapon systems and base related infrastructure. Functional areas that are
        included under the Engineering Services discipline include but, are not limited to the
        following:</p>
