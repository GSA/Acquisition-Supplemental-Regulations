<p>Discuss events during the solicitation process.</p>
<p>A. Pre-bid conferences (FAR 14.207), pre-solicitation conferences (other than Industry Days described in Section III above), pre-construction orientations, or other exchanges with industry before receipt of proposal (FAR 15.201).</p>
<p>B. How the solicitation was made available.</p>
<p>C. Questions received and answered.</p>
<p>D. Amendments issued and resultant changes to acquisition planning.</p>
<p>E. Protests before closing of the solicitation. </p>
<p>F. Extent competition solicited and secured. Include information on contractors expressing interest during the solicitation period and offers received in response to the solicitation. If any offerors not submitting a proposal gave an explanation for their decision not to submit a proposal, summarize the explanation. If only one offer was received, explain why the proposal will or will not be considered competitive. </p>
<p>G. Oral presentations (FAR 15.102). If oral presentations were used, summarize the process including which parts of the proposal were presented orally and participants. Content of oral proposals should be included in sections on evaluation below. </p>
<p>H. Summary table of proposals. Show a summary table of offerors' prices and ratings/evaluation for each factor required by the solicitation such as technical, past performance, other non-cost factors, and cost. Attachment may be used. </p>
<p>SECTION VI &ndash; PRE-NEGOTIATION ANALYSIS.</p>
<p>[The business clearance should be a stand-alone document which explains the offer(s) and the Government&rsquo;s evaluation of the offer(s). An understanding of the development of each position is important to be adequately prepared for negotiations, to determine a competitive range, or to decide to award without negotiations. This section should be tailored to the specific solicitation&rsquo;s procedures for evaluation of cost/price and other non-cost factors included in the solicitation.]</p>
<p>Document the methodology used by the offeror(s) in developing the proposal(s) both from cost and non-cost stand-points and the methodology used by the Government in developing its negotiation position(s). Include discussion of recommendations from field pricing/technical/audit reviews, which recommendations were or were not used and why the recommendations used were considered appropriate for use in developing the Government&rsquo;s independent pre-negotiation position(s). </p>
<p>Address each factor used for evaluation as follows:</p>

<p>A. Technical Evaluation (FAR 15.305(a)(3)). For each subfactor under the technical factor, give the adjectival ratings or raw scores for each offeror. Show the weighting or other means of determining the overall score for the factor (15.305). Discuss any clarifications obtained in the process of the evaluation or other communications with offerors before establishment of the competitive range (FAR 15.306). Summarize the technical weaknesses and deficiencies of each offeror. </p>
<p>B. Past Performance Evaluation (FAR 15.305(a)(2)). For each subfactor under the past performance factor, give the adjectival ratings or raw score for each offeror. Show the weighting or other means of determining the overall score for the factor. Discuss any clarifications obtained in the process of the evaluation or instances where an offeror was given access to adverse past performance information to which the offeror had not previously had an opportunity to respond (FAR 15.306). Summarize weaknesses or deficiencies of each offeror. This factor should include evaluation of past performance under subcontracting plans if required by DFARS 215.305(a)(2).</p>
<p>C. Other Non-Cost Factor Evaluation. For each subfactor under any non-cost evaluation factor, give the adjectival or raw score for each offeror. Show the weighting or other means of determining an overall score for the factor. Discuss any clarifications obtained in the process of the evaluation or other communications with offerors before establishment of the competitive range (FAR 15.306). Summarize the weaknesses and deficiencies of each offeror. </p>
<p>D. Cost/Price and Profit/Fee Analysis (FAR 15.305(a)(1)). [Evaluation of proposals may be done through cost analysis, price analysis, or a combination of the two techniques. The necessity for a separate profit/fee analysis is dependent on the extent of price analysis (FAR 15.404(c)(1) and DFARS 215.404(c)(1)).]</p>
<p> 1. Price analysis (FAR 15.404-1(b)). </p>
<p>a. Provide a summary comparison by line item or cost element, as appropriate to the solicitation, for all offerors and the Government&rsquo;s position or IGE. </p>
<p>b. Document how the price was determined to be fair and reasonable. If determining price reasonableness based on adequate price competition, the clearance should address the criteria of FAR 15.403-1(c)(1). If prices are set by law or regulation, specify the basis for the price cited (FAR 15.403-1(c)(2). Price reasonableness determinations based on comparison to historical prices, catalogue prices, market prices, or other such benchmarks should establish comparability of the supplies/services. The prices being compared should be specified in the clearance or an attachment. If catalogue prices are used for comparison, availability of such prices to the public should be addressed.</p>
<p>2. Cost evaluation (FAR 15.404-1(c)). </p>
<p>a. Provide a summary comparison for each offeror in columnar format of (i) the offeror's proposal, (ii) the audit recommendations (FAR 15.404-2(c)), if requested, (iii) the field pricing recommendations (FAR 15.404-2(a)), if requested, and, (iv) the pre&#8209;negotiation position by elements of cost. [Elements of cost may vary. The following is a notional format.]<br></p>
