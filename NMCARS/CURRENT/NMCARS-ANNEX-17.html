<p>2.3.6.1 An analysis of the capabilities of the national technology and industrial base to develop, produce, maintain, and support such program, including-- </p>
<p>(a) The availability of essential raw materials, special alloys, composite materials, components, tooling, and production test equipment for the sustained production of systems fully capable of meeting the performance objectives established for those systems; the uninterrupted maintenance and repair of such systems; and the sustained operation of such systems.</p>
<p>(b) The identification of items that are available only from sources outside the national technology and industrial base.</p>
<p>(c) The availability of alternatives for obtaining such items from within the national technology and industrial base if such items become unavailable from sources outside the national technology and industrial base; and an analysis of any military vulnerability that could result from the lack of reasonable alternatives.</p>
<p>(d) The effects on the national technology and industrial base that result from foreign acquisition of firms in the United States.</p>
<p>2.3.6.2 Consideration of requirements for efficient manufacture during the design and production of the systems to be procured under the program.</p>
<p>2.3.6.3 The use of advanced manufacturing technology, processes, and systems during the research and development phase and the production phase of the program.</p>
<p>2.3.6.4 To the maximum extent practicable, the use of contract solicitations that encourage competing offerors to acquire, for use in the performance of the contract, modern technology, production equipment, and production systems (including hardware and software) that increase the productivity of the offerors and reduce the life-cycle costs.</p>
<p>2.3.6.5 Methods to encourage investment by U.S. domestic sources in advanced manufacturing technology production equipment and processes through&mdash;</p>
<p>(a) Recognition of the contractor&rsquo;s investment in advanced manufacturing technology production equipment, processes, and organization of work systems that build on workers&rsquo; skill and experience, and work force skill development in the development of the contract objective; and</p>
<p>(b) Increased emphasis in source selection on the efficiency of production.</p>
<p>2.3.6.6 Expanded use of commercial manufacturing processes rather than processes specified by DOD.</p>

<p class="List3">(i) If, in the IC strategy, the development of a detailed IC plan was determined to be applicable, include the plan by text or by reference. If the development of the IC plan was determined not to be applicable, summarize the details of the analysis forming the basis of this decision.</p>
<p class="List3">(ii) If the program involves peacetime and wartime hardware configurations that are supported by logistics support plans, identify their impact on the IC plan.</p>
<p>2.3.6.11<span style="color:#000000 !important"> Assess the long-term technical data and computer software needs of those systems and subsystems; and establish acquisition strategies that provide for the technical data and computer software deliverables and associated license rights needed to sustain those systems and subsystems over their life cycle. The strategy may include&mdash;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000 !important">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of maintenance capabilities within DOD; or  </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000 !important">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition for contracts for sustainment of the systems or subsystems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>2.3.6.12 Include a plan for the preservation and storage of special tooling associated with the production of hardware for MDAPs through the end of the service life of the related weapons system. The plan shall include the identification of any contract clauses, facilities, and funding required for the preservation and storage of such tooling.</p>
<p>2.3.7 Discuss the use of category management, including strategic sourcing. Address whether the requirement can be achieved through an existing Federal, DOD, or DON contract vehicle. If establishing a new contract vehicle when a similar solution exists, include supporting information to justify why it is necessary to meet the requirement. In addition, address category management tier solutions and Analysis of Alternative (AoA) requirements, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum M-19-13, for all common requirements. </p>
<p>2.4 <em> Competition. </em></p>
<p>2.4.1 Describe how competition will be sought, promoted, and sustained throughout the course of the acquisition. If full and open competition is not contemplated, cite the appropriate FAR authority. Discuss the basis for the application of that authority, identify the source(s), and discuss why full and open competition cannot be obtained.</p>
<p>2.4.2 Identify any known barriers to increasing subcontract competition and address how to overcome them, if possible.</p>

<p class="List3">(i) Licensing of additional suppliers.</p>
<p>(j) Periodic system or program reviews to address long-term competitive effects of program decisions.</p>
<p>2.5 <em>Contract type selection.</em> </p>
<p>2.5.1 Discuss the rationale for the selection of contract type. Provide an analysis of why the use of that contract type is appropriate (e.g., complexity of the requirements, uncertain duration of the work, contractor&rsquo;s technical capability and financial responsibility, or adequacy of the contractor&rsquo;s accounting system). Discuss the opportunity to transition from cost type to fixed priced contracts, if applicable. Provide rationale if procuring services that are performance-based and a contract type other than a firm-fixed price is contemplated.</p>
<p>2.5.2 Discuss the use and authority of multi-year contracting or other special contracting methods.</p>
<p>2.5.3 Discuss any applicable FAR or DFARS deviations that will be required.</p>
