            <div class="body" id="d1e4075__i1026066">
               <p class="p List3">(a) Approval by the
SSA of a source selection plan identifying only agency/FFRDC personnel
as evaluators may constitute the determination that sufficient personnel
are available within the agency to evaluate or analyze proposals. Determinations
that sufficient personnel are not readily available within the agency
nor within another Federal agency shall be made in accordance with
(d) below. (b)(1)(i) Activities should use common sense and reasonably available
information in determining which other Federal agencies or Navy/Marine
Corps activities may have personnel with the training and capabilities
required to support evaluation of proposals. The nature and extent
of efforts an activity should pursue in obtaining information depend
on the circumstances of the procurement, taking into consideration
such factors as those listed in FAR 37.204(b), the specialized nature
of the qualifications and expertise required, and the activity’s
previous experience in attempting to identify similarly qualified
personnel. (ii) Qualified employees of another agency who could
only be available at times other than when needed to conduct a planned evaluation
of proposals may be considered “not readily available” if it is
not practical to adjust the evaluation schedule to accommodate using
them. (c) If another agency will make personnel available on a reimbursable
basis, Subpart 17.5 will generally apply. (d) HCAs are delegated
authority to determine that personnel with the required training and
capabilities needed to conduct evaluations or analyses of any aspect
of proposals for an initial contract award are not readily available
within the agency or other Federal agencies. The procedures in FAR
Subpart 1.7 apply to HCA determinations made under this section.</p>
