of bids.</title>
            <conbody>
               <p outputclass="List1">(a) Contracting offices should
ensure that bids are promptly identified and forwarded, unopened,
for deposit in the bid box. Bid envelopes received by mail should
be timestamped immediately upon receipt. Handcarried bids may not
be accepted by government employees but are to be deposited in the
bid box by the bidder or his representative. Insofar as possible, bid
samples should receive the same degree of security as is afforded
bids, and should be accounted for by the maintenance of local records.
Under no circumstances are bid samples to be given away, loaned,
diverted, or used for any purpose other than that intended.</p>
