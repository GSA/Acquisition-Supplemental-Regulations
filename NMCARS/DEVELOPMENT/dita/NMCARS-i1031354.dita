               <p outputclass="Normal">Notwithstanding the requirements
in FAR 7.105 and DFARS 207.105, the Navy acquisition planning process
is streamlined to describe the irreducible minimum content allowed
for a STRAP. The specific content of STRAPs shall conform to the
templates found in Annexes 17 through 20 (see 5207.103 for additional
details, including approvals). For revisions to an individual contract
within a previously approved PSTRAP or PSTRAP-M (as appropriate),
use of an ISTRAP or ISTRAP-M for the individual contract is acceptable.</p>
               <p outputclass="List1">(S-90) (a) The planner shall submit a PSTRAP,
using Annex 17 or Annex 19, when the requirements office chooses
to write a single plan for all known program actions.</p>
               <p outputclass="List1">(b) The planner shall submit an ISTRAP,
Annex 18 or Annex 20, when there is only one contract, task or delivery
order to be covered by the plan.</p>
