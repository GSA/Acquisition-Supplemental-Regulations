               <p outputclass="List1">(S-90) (a) Each undefinitized
change order shall include a not-to-exceed price unless the CCO
waives this requirement.</p>
               <p outputclass="List1">(b) The policies and procedures of DFARS
217.74 shall be applied to change orders (except value engineering
change proposals (VECPs)) to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
               <p outputclass="List1">(c) The use of VECPs are encouraged due
to the potential savings and system improvements that may be realized.</p>
               <p outputclass="List2">(1) Prompt action shall be taken to implement
those VECPs deemed to be technically sound.</p>
               <p outputclass="List2">(2) When considering VECPs, contracting
officers shall consider the impact on the projected savings that
the normal negotiation and definitization process would have versus
use of an unpriced change order. Unpriced contract modifications that
implement VECPs shall:</p>
               <p outputclass="List3">(i) Define minimum unit cost savings, and</p>
               <p outputclass="List3">(ii) Define maximum development/implementation
costs</p>
