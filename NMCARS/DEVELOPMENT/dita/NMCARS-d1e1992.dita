of bids.</title>
            <body>
               <p outputclass="List1">(a) Contracting offices should ensure
that bids are promptly identified and forwarded, unopened, for deposit
in the bid box. Bid envelopes received by mail should be timestamped
immediately upon receipt. Handcarried bids may not be accepted by
government employees but are to be deposited in the bid box by the
bidder or his representative. Insofar as possible, bid samples should
receive the same degree of security as is afforded bids, and should
be accounted for by the maintenance of local records. Under no circumstances
are bid samples to be given away, loaned, diverted, or used for
any purpose other than that intended.</p>
