               <p outputclass="List1">(a) Where insurance is required,
the lease shall require the lessee to:</p>
               <p outputclass="List2">(1) purchase and maintain Fire and Extended
Coverage insurance or its equivalent and, if applicable, Boiler
and Machinery insurance, in an amount equal to replacement value
less depreciation or in any lesser amount determined by the contracting
officer.</p>
               <p outputclass="List2">(2) provide insurance on special types
of property (e. g., floating drydocks, mobile power plants, etc.)
as designated by lessor.</p>
               <p outputclass="List1">(b) When a co-insurance clause is used,
failure of the lessee to maintain adequate insurance does not relieve
the lessee of its responsibilities under any other terms of the
lease.</p>
