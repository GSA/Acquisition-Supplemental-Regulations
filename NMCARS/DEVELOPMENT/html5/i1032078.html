participate both as prime contractors and as subcontractors.</p>

at DON contracting activities are normally conducted as a segment
of the PPMAP reviews (see 5201.691). The Director, OSBP, will establish
guidelines for the PPMAP review SBP segment. PPMAP review SBP segments
should be coordinated with the PPMAP review team leader. For reviews
under 5201.691-2, the Director, OSBP, will designate SBP review
team members. Associate Directors of Small Business are responsible
for implementation of the PPMAP review SBP segment of their field
contracting activities including designating PPMAP review SBP team
members and monitoring compliance with their recommendations. Team
members should generally be Deputies for Small Business from other
than the activity under review. Associate Directors of Small Business
are responsible for providing a copy of the PPMAP review SBP segment
report(s) to the Director, OSBP.</p>

from the cognizant CAO, and shall do so for any subcontracting plan
that does not contain positive goals. The CAO should be specifically
requested to review the factors used by the prime contractor to
develop the zero goal, the past performance of the offeror on similar
requirements, and the current procedures used by the offeror to
maximize opportunities for small business, veteran-owned small business,
service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business,
small disadvantaged business and women-owned small business concerns
to participate in its subcontracting program. The contracting officer
shall consider the CAO’s findings, including any recommendations,
prior to approval of the subcontracting plan. The contract file
shall be documented to reflect the review and the contracting officer's
final decision relative to an acceptable goal. If the contracting
officer determines that a subcontracting plan containing a zero
goal is appropriate, the determination shall be approved at a level
above the contracting officer and placed in the contract file.</p>

concurrent with submission to SBA. Declination letters are subject
