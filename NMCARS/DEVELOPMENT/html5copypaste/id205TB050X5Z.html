         <p class="p List1">Examples: (i) The proposed contract was
synopsized on the Beta.SAM website on July 6, 2005</p>
         <p class="p pindented1">and only EFG Corporation expressed
an interest in this requirement. No additional market research was
conducted because it is not practicable, for the reasons discussed
in paragraph 5 above, for any company other than EFG to provide
the required supplies and services.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The proposed contract was synopsized
on the Beta.SAM website on July 6, 2005. In</p>
         <p class="p Normal">addition to EFG Corporation, responses
were received from BBCC Company and from AGW Ltd. Representatives
of the Program Office and the contracting officer held discussions
with BBCC and AGW. Subsequently, both companies, based on a better
understanding of the Navy's requirements, indicated in writing they
were no longer interested in pursuing a prime contract. No additional
market research was conducted because it is not practicable, for
the reasons discussed in paragraph 5 above, for any company other
than EFG to provide the required supplies and services.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) The proposed contract was synopsized
on the Beta.SAM website on July 6, 2005 and no</p>
         <p class="p pindented1">other potential sources expressed
an interest in this requirement. In an effort to identify competitive
interest, the Naval ABC Command, Industrial Sources Division, as
part of their market research, provides more than 850 commercial
entities, on an annual basis, a listing of items for which it is
seeking competitive sources, as well as instructions for obtaining
source approval information. Additionally, the availability of the
listing is periodically publicized in</p>
         <p class="p Normal">Beta.SAM and feedback is requested regarding
market capabilities. To date, no other</p>
         <p class="p pindented1">companies have expressed interest
in becoming qualified to compete for the items to be acquired under
the proposed contract.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) NAVCOM's ABC Division, the Navy's
Center of Excellence for XYZ systems, maintains in-depth knowledge
of XYZ technology developments and the XYZ industrial base. This
includes insight into technologies that individual companies are
focused on and their technical and production capabilities. ABC
Division representatives maintain this knowledge through routine
review of industry journals and attendance at industry symposia
and conferences. They also periodically visit industry facilities
for briefings on companies' IR&amp;D efforts. Based on its knowledge and
expertise, ABC Division has determined that no companies other than
RST Corporation have the knowledge and technical capability required
to provide the XYZ-24</p>
         <p class="p Normal">systems. The lack of any responses to
a synopsis of the planned contract published on the</p>
         <p class="p Normal">Beta.SAM website on June 5, 2005 validates
ABC Division's determination.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) Members of activity's technical, logistics
and contracting community outside the contiguous United States conduct market
research on a continual basis. Annually they visit each site where
system maintenance and component repairs are performed. During these
visits, they meet with local contractors and on-site government
representatives to review current capabilities and potential changes
in system maintenance/repair requirements. Based on information
gathered during their most recent visits, the activity outside the
contiguous United States has determined that only the current contractors
are capable of meeting the Navy's requirements. A synopsis of these
planned contracts has not been published. In accordance with FAR
5.202(a)(12), a synopsis is not required when the contract action
is by a Defense agency and the proposed contract action will be
made and performed outside the United States and its outlying areas,
and only local sources will be solicited.</p>

Cost. The Contracting Officer has determined the anticipated cost
to the Government of the supplies/services covered by this J&amp;A

paragraph 7 need only contain the above statement. No additional

         <p class="p pindented1">8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future
Competition.</p>
         <p class="p pindented1">[If there is currently no reasonable
likelihood of future competition, use the following or similar language:</p>
         <p class="p pindented1">For the reasons set forth in Paragraph
5, NAVSYSCOM has no plans at this time to compete future contacts
for the types of supplies/services covered by this document. If
another potential source emerges, NAVSYSCOM will assess whether
competition for future requirements is feasible.]</p>
         <p class="p pindented1">[Discuss any actions the activity
plans to take to change conditions that would preclude the use of
full and open competition for acquiring the same or similar supplies
or services in the future. In addition to acquiring a validated
technical data package, such actions might include, for example,
development of a performance specification, use of reverse engineering
to develop a second source or, after justifying noncompetitive procurement
of emergency supplies/services on the basis of unusual and compelling
urgency, using competition to award contract vehicles for requirements
at quantities greater than the emergent need, or for similar items
if needed to meet future emergency situations.]</p>
         <p class="p pindented1">[If future competition is planned,
provide the estimated date of the first competitive acquisition.

supplies or services to be acquired including quantities by fiscal
year for major items, the total estimated value of the contract,
with funding summary, and identification of the planning document
(e.g., the Streamlined Acquisition Plan (STRAP)/Strategy) that supports
the procurement. If none, explain why not.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">Example: This J&amp;A covers award of
a contract to ABC Aircraft Company, a fully owned subsidiary of
DEF Company, for the SDD phase of the XYZ Program. This effort will
include the design and development of an air vehicle, including
two Ground Test Vehicles and five Engineering Development models,
testing, engineering studies and related supplies and services.
The estimated total value of the contract is $X,XB and will be funded
with FY06 through FY11 RDT&amp;E funds. The planned contract is
supported by NAVAIR Acquisition Strategy 050-03-01, approved by
USD(AT&amp;L) on SEP 5, 2005.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">Example: This J&amp;A covers award of
a contract to LGI Corporation for performance-based logistics support
of the EFG system. The contract will include a three-year base period
and four one-year options. Total estimated value of the contract
is $123M and will be funded with Navy Working Capital Funds (NWCF).
The J&amp;A is consistent with NAVICP STRAP Plan No. 12345, approved
July 8, 2005 by PEO(ABC).</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[In a few sentences, summarize the rationale
set forth in Paragraph 5 of the J&amp;A for using other than full
and open competition. Address other information necessary to provide
a context for the procurement and facilitate understanding of the
proposed business approach. Additional information might explain,
for example, that:</p>
         <p class="p Normal">the planned contract is a final buyout
of the requirement,</p>
         <p class="p Normal">the sole source was determined through
a prior competitive down-selection,</p>
         <p class="p Normal">under a prior contract the program experienced
significant cost savings when it broke out the requirements covered
by the planned contract from a larger system integration contract,</p>
         <p class="p Normal">the contractor plans to integrate work
under the contract with a commercial production line, or</p>
         <p class="p Normal">the contractor plans to enter into a partnering
arrangement with another firm or Government entity for highly specialized requirements.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">Example: PRP is the sole designer, developer
and manufacturer of the XX-46 series radar system and is the only
contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience and technical
data that can meet the Government’s requirements on a timely basis.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">Example: MN Corporation is the sole designer,
developer and manufacturer of the F-XX-416 series engines and is
the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience and
technical data that can provide the required performance-based logistics support
for these engines. Until 2001, MN supported these engines as a subcontractor
to the prime contractor for the entire F-112 aircraft support contract.
Breaking out this portion of the total system effort resulted in
a 22% reduction in F-XX-416 engine support costs.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">Example: The J&amp;A cites 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)
as the statutory exception justifying use of other than full and
open competition. This exception applies when it is necessary to
award the contract to establish or maintain an esis uniquely qualified
to provide these services because of its unquestioned objectivity
and lack of potential conflicts of interest, its confidentiality
in protecting very sensitive military and intelligence information,
its familiarity with the needs of the Navy and Marine Corps, and
its establishment of a continuing research agenda for the Navy and
Marine Corps.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[Briefly explain any differences between
information included in the J&amp;A and information in the supporting
Acquisition Strategy/Plan and explain the rationale for these differences.
Pay particular attention to differences in quantities and funding levels.
Also, note any significant congressional or other programmatic issues.
These may include, for example:</p>
         <p class="p Normal">pending legislation that could impact
the procurement,</p>
         <p class="p Normal">known congressional concerns with the
acquisition strategy, or</p>
         <p class="p Normal">recent test results that might delay the

For each subfactor under the past performance factor, give the adjectival ratings
or raw score for each offeror. Show the weighting or other means
of determining the overall score for the factor. Discuss any clarifications
obtained in the process of the evaluation or instances where an
offeror was given access to adverse past performance information
to which the offeror had not previously had an opportunity to respond
(FAR 15.306). Summarize weaknesses or deficiencies of each offeror.
This factor should include evaluation of past performance under
subcontracting plans if required by DFARS 215.305(a)(2).</p>
         <p class="p Normal">C. Other Non-Cost Factor Evaluation. For
each subfactor under any non-cost evaluation factor, give the adjectival
or raw score for each offeror. Show the weighting or other means
of determining an overall score for the factor. Discuss any clarifications
obtained in the process of the evaluation or other communications
with offerors before establishment of the competitive range (FAR
15.306). Summarize the weaknesses and deficiencies of each offeror.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">D. Cost/Price and Profit/Fee Analysis
(FAR 15.305(a)(1)). [Evaluation of proposals may be done through
cost analysis, price analysis, or a combination of the two techniques.
The necessity for a separate profit/fee analysis is dependent on
the extent of price analysis (FAR 15.404(c)(1) and DFARS 215.404(c)(1)).]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">1. Price analysis (FAR 15.404-1(b)).</p>
         <p class="p Normal">a. Provide a summary comparison by line
item or cost element, as appropriate to the solicitation, for all
offerors and the Government’s position or IGE.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">b. Document how the price was determined
to be fair and reasonable. If determining price reasonableness based
on adequate price competition, the clearance should address the
criteria of FAR 15.403-1(c)(1). If prices are set by law or regulation,
specify the basis for the price cited (FAR 15.403-1(c)(2). Price
reasonableness determinations based on comparison to historical
prices, catalogue prices, market prices, or other such benchmarks
should establish comparability of the supplies/services. The prices being
compared should be specified in the clearance or an attachment.
If catalogue prices are used for comparison, availability of such
prices to the public should be addressed.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">2. Cost evaluation (FAR 15.404-1(c)).</p>
         <p class="p List1">a. Provide a summary comparison for each
offeror in columnar format of (i) the offeror's proposal, (ii) the
audit recommendations (FAR 15.404-2(c)), if requested, (iii) the
field pricing recommendations (FAR 15.404-2(a)), if requested, and,
(iv) the prenegotiation position by elements of cost. [Elements
of cost may vary. The following is a notional format.]</p>

         <p class="p Normal">2. Methodology Used in Market Research</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[Explain how the restricted items to be

item(s) were identified and what the individual equipment items
are. Specify the restricted items involved to the degree possible.</p>

         <p class="p Normal">Identify whether information about the
restricted items/material was provided by a</p>
         <p class="p Normal">prime contractor or subcontractor for
the end item or component involved.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">3. Issues</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[Summarize issues investigated relative
to contractor’s assertion of non-availability. Examples are: predominant
industry location, status of industry in qualifying countries, alternative
materials/parts, US Government market share, cost of changes, Original
Equipment Manufacturer, Qualified Parts List, or any other qualification
required.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">4. Findings of Market Research</p>
         <p class="p Normal">a. Materials/Suppliers – [Discuss manufacturers
contacted, location of manufacturer and sources of supply, whether
the manufacturer can track the material or items to source, degree
of compliance/non-compliance asserted, willingness to analyze items for
compliance if not already known, any conclusions as to veracity
of compliance statements. If the manufacturer states its parts are
compliant but the sources of supply (vendors) contradict or undermine
this statement, this should be noted. If a manufacturer or supplier’s
interpretation of the material or item requirements is incorrect,
this should be noted. Examples of this would be an assumption that
reprocessing or dying of fibers, yarns, fabrics, or materials qualified
or that the small purchase exception is applicable at lower tiers
of subcontracting. If more than one type of restricted material
or item is involved in the DNAD, each should be treated in a separate
section.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">b. State of Industry – [Discuss research
done on the industry overall. This would include studies done by
other organizations, annual industry sales and the US Government
market share, information obtained from sources such as the Defense
Logistics Agency, Department of Commerce or National Association
of Manufacturers, internet surveys conducted, information obtained from
other DNADs, commercial aspects of the industry. Discuss what portion
of manufacturers and/or suppliers are represented in this document
and efforts to identify additional sources through means such as
notices in the Commerce Business Daily or Urgent Data Requests through
the Government Industry Data Exchange Program.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">c. Other Issues – [Discuss any other issues
relevant to this DNAD such as logistics considerations or whether
an item is a critical capability for DOD].</p>
         <p class="p Normal">5. Alternatives Considered and Effects
of Compliance</p>
         <p class="p Normal">a. Material/part alternatives considered
and effects of compliance – [Explain the economic and schedule consequences
if compliance were mandated for the specific material/part. This
would include costs and time to build facilities, costs of insuring
compliant materials were segregated in the supply system, redesign
costs, or costs of any other alternatives considered.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal"></p>
         <p class="p Normal">b. Alternative Acquisition Strategies
Considered – [Explain any alternatives considered to buying the
noncompliant material/part. These alternatives may include considering
different end items to fulfill the requirement or using a different
component/part in the end item. Effects of alternatives in terms
of reengineering, delayed deliveries, mission impacts, etcetera,
should be explained. Address the price reasonableness of buying
compliant alternatives; can the price of the alternative be determined
to be fair and reasonable?].</p>
         <p class="p Normal">6. Recommendation/Signatures</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[Briefly, summarize conclusions and give
a recommendation. If analysis was performed by a support contractor
or an organization other than the requiring activity, signatures
should be identified to that organization/contractor and certification
of why alternatives are not acceptable should be provided as an
additional section or separate document].</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[If this analysis was performed by the
requiring activity, the certification as to why alternatives are
not acceptable should be included in this section along with the
requiring activity signatures.]</p>

the determination that the price of the item to be acquired is fair

herein may be contained in separate memos, if desired.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">2. Methodology Used in Market Research</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[Explain how directly purchased specialty
metal or end items or components/parts thereof, containing the specialty
metal were identified and what the parts are. Specify the specialty
metals involved to the degree possible.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal"></p>
         <p class="p Normal">[If this request covers a group of parts
and a representative sample was selected, explain the total number
of parts involved and the procedures for selecting the sample. An
example would be that a list of all parts was assembled and a random
number generator was used to select a specific percentage of the
items. Note whether such selection was made by the contractor or
the Government.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[Identify whether information about the
parts/material was provided by a prime contractor or subcontractor
for the end item or component involved.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">3. Issues</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[Summarize issues investigated relative
to contractor’s assertion of non-availability. Examples are: predominant
industry location, status of industry in qualifying countries, alternative
materials/parts, US Government market share, cost of changes, Original
Equipment Manufacturer, Qualified Parts List, or any other qualification
(such as FAA approval) required.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">4. Findings of Market Research</p>
         <p class="p Normal">a. Materials/Suppliers – [Discuss manufacturers
contacted, location of manufacturer and sources of supply, whether
the manufacturer can track specialty metals to source, degree of
compliance/non-compliance asserted, willingness to analyze parts
for compliance if not already known, any conclusions as to veracity
of compliance statements. If the manufacturer states its parts are
compliant but the sources of supply (vendors) contradict or undermine
this statement, this should be noted. If a manufacturer or supplier’s
interpretation of the specialty metal requirements is incorrect,
this should be noted. Examples of this would be an assumption that
remelting of a specialty metal qualified or that the small purchase
exception is applicable at lower tiers of subcontracting. If more
than one part or type of specialty metal is involved in the DNAD,
each should be treated in a separate section.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">b. State of Industry – [Discuss research
done on the industry overall. This would include studies done by
other organizations, annual industry sales and the US Government
market share, information obtained from sources such as the Department
of Commerce or National Association of Manufacturers, internet surveys
conducted, information obtained from other DNADs, commercial aspects
of the industry. Discuss what portion of manufacturers and/or suppliers
are represented in this document and efforts to identify additional
sources through means such as notices in the Commerce Business Daily
or Urgent Data Requests through the Government Industry Data Exchange
Program.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">c. Other Issues – [Discuss any other issues
relevant to this DNAD such as logistics considerations or whether
an item is a critical capability for DOD.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">5. Alternatives Considered and Effects
of Compliance</p>
         <p class="p Normal">a. Material/part alternatives considered
and effects of compliance - [Explain the economic and schedule consequences
if compliance were mandated for the specific material/part. This
would include costs and time to build facilities, costs of insuring
compliant metals were segregated in the supply system, redesign
costs, or costs of any other alternative considered.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">b. Alternative acquisition Strategies
considered –[Explain any alternatives considered to buying the noncompliant
material/part. These alternatives may include considering different
end items to fulfill the requirement or using a different component/part
in the end item. Effects of alternatives in terms of reengineering,
delayed</p>
         <p class="p Normal">deliveries, mission impacts, etcetera,
should be explained. Address the price</p>
         <p class="p Normal">reasonableness of buying compliant alternatives;
can the price of the alternative be determined to be fair and reasonable?]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">6. Recommendation/Signatures</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[Briefly, summarize conclusions and give
a recommendation. If analysis was performed by a support contractor
or an organization other than the requiring activity, signatures
should be identified to that organization/contractor and certification
of why alternatives are not acceptable should be provided as an
additional section or separate document.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[If this analysis was performed by the
requiring activity, the certification as to why alternatives are
not acceptable should be included in this section along with the
requiring activity signatures.]</p>

must clearly demonstrate that the Phase III work derives from, extends,
or completes efforts performed under Phase I and Phase II.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">4. Identification of Statutory Authority.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5), as implemented by
FAR 6.302-5: Authorized or Required by Statute.</p>
         <p class="p Normal" id="i1049072__i1049074">15 U.S.C. 638(r)(1) states:</p>
         <p class="p Normal">“In the case of a small business concern
that is awarded a funding agreement for Phase II of an SBIR or STTR
program, a Federal agency may enter into a Phase III agreement with
that business concern for additional work to be performed during

         <p class="p Normal" id="i1049072__i1049076">Furthermore, 15 U.S.C.
638(r)(4) states:</p>

agencies and Federal prime contractors shall issue Phase III awards
relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR
and STTR award recipients that developed the technology.”</p>
         <p class="p Normal">5. Demonstration that Proposed Contractor’s
Unique Qualifications or Nature of Acquisition Requires Use of Authority Cited.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">The nature of the acquisition requires
the use of the authority cited. The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured
in three phases. Phase I (project feasibility) determines the scientific,
technical and commercial merit and feasibility of the ideas submitted.
Phase II (project development to prototype) is the major research
and development effort, funding the prototyping and demonstration of
the most promising Phase I projects. Phase III (commercialization)
is the ultimate goal of the SBIR/STTR Programs. Because the Phase
III work derives from, extends, or completes efforts performed under
Phase I and Phase II, use of the authority cited is required.</p>

of contractor]___ is being considered for Phase III award due to
the nature of the acquisition. In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(7),
this proposed contract action does not require public notification
to the GPE.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable
Cost.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">The Contracting Officer will determine
prior to award that the negotiated price of the contract executed
under this justification is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR
Subpart 15.4. This determination will be documented in ___[list
applicable location of the determination, e.g. Business Clearance
Memorandum]___, which will be included in the contract file.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">8. Description of Market Research or Statement
of the Reason Market Research was not Conducted.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">FAR 10.001(a)(2) indicates that market
research appropriate to the circumstances must be conducted. SBIR
Phase III procurements are such that traditional market research
to identify alternative sources is generally unnecessary. As described
above, the Phase III work derives from, extends, or completes efforts
performed under Phase I and Phase II.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">NOTE (delete after reading): Notwithstanding
the statement above, market research may be performed if appropriate.
If any market research was performed, describe in this section.</p>

         <span class="ph autonumber"></span> ANNEX 16 – STATEMENT OF WORK LANGUAGE
IMPLEMENTING “THE DIB” MEMO</h2>
      <div class="body">
         <p class="p Normal">The following SOW language shall
be used to supplement DFARS Clause 252.204-7012 entitled, “Safeguarding
Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting” where
the Department of the Navy Program Manager, Program Executive Officer
or Chief of Naval Research, in coordination with Resource Sponsor,
determines that the risk to a critical program and/or technology
warrants its inclusion.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">1. System Security Plan and Plans of Action
and Milestones (SSP/POAM) Reviews</p>
         <p class="p Normal">a) Within thirty (30) days of contract
award, the Contractor shall make its System Security Plan(s) (SSP(s))
for its covered contractor information system(s) available for review
by the Government at the contractor’s facility. The SSP(s) shall
implement the security requirements in Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.204-7012, which is included
in this contract. The Contractor shall fully cooperate in the Government’s
review of the SSPs at the Contractor’s facility.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">b) If the Government determines that the
SSP(s) does not adequately implement the requirements of DFARS clause
252.204-7012 then the Government shall notify the Contractor of
each identified deficiency. The Contractor shall correct any identified deficiencies
within thirty (30) days of notification by the Government. The contracting
officer may provide for a correction period longer than thirty (30)
days and, in such a case, may require the Contractor to submit a
plan of action and milestones (POAM) for the correction of the identified
deficiencies. The Contractor shall immediately notify the contracting
officer of any failure or anticipated failure to meet a milestone
in such a POAM.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">c) Upon the conclusion of the correction
period, the Government may conduct a follow-on review of the SSP(s)
at the Contractor’s facilities. The Government may continue to conduct
follow-on reviews until the Government determines that the Contractor
has corrected all identified deficiencies in the SSP(s).</p>
         <p class="p Normal">d) The Government may, in its sole discretion,
conduct subsequent reviews at the Contractor’s site to verify the
information in the SSP(s). The Government will conduct such reviews
at least every three (3) years (measured from the date of contract award)
and may conduct such reviews at any time upon thirty (30) days’
notice to the Contractor.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">2. Compliance to NIST 800-171</p>
         <p class="p Normal">a) The Contractor shall fully implement
the CUI Security Requirements (Requirements) and associated Relevant
Security Controls (Controls) in NIST Special Publication 800-171
(Rev. 1) (NIST SP 800-171), or establish a SSP(s) and POA&amp;Ms
that varies from NIST 800-171 only in accordance with DFARS clause
252.204-7012(b)(2), for all covered contractor information systems
affecting this contract.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">b) Notwithstanding the allowance for such
variation, the contractor shall identify in any SSP and POA&amp;M
their plans to implement the following, at a minimum:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Implement Control 3.5.3 (Multi-factor
authentication). This means that multi-factor authentication is
required for all users, privileged and unprivileged accounts that
log into a network. In other words, any system that is not standalone should
be required to utilize acceptable multi-factor authentication. For
legacy systems and systems that cannot support this requirement,
such as CNC equipment, etc., a combination of physical and logical
protections acceptable to the Government may be substituted;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Implement Control 3.1.5 (least privilege)
and associated Controls, and identify practices that the contractor
implements to restrict the unnecessary sharing with, or flow of,
covered defense information to its subcontractors, suppliers, or
vendors based on need-to-know principles;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Implement Control 3.1.12 (monitoring
and control remote access sessions) - Require monitoring and controlling
of remote access sessions and include mechanisms to audit the sessions
and methods.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Audit user privileges on at least an
annual basis;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Implement:</p>
         <p class="p Normal">i. Control 3.13.11 (FIPS 140-2 validated
cryptology or implementation of NSA or NIST approved algorithms
(i.e. FIPS 140-2 Annex A: AES or Triple DES) or compensating controls
as documented in a SSP and POAM); and,</p>
         <p class="p Normal">ii. NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation
Program (CAVP) (see https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program);</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Implement Control 3.13.16 (Protect
the confidentiality of CUI at rest) or provide a POAM for implementation
which shall be evaluated by the Navy for risk acceptance.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) Implement Control 3.1.19 (encrypt CUI
on mobile devices) or provide a plan of action for implementation
which can be evaluated by the Government Program Manager for risk
to the program.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">3. Cyber Incident Response:</p>
         <p class="p Normal">a) The Contractor shall, within fifteen
(15) days of discovering the cyber incident (inclusive of the 72-hour
reporting period), deliver all data used in performance of the contract
that the Contractor determines is impacted by the incident and begin
assessment of potential warfighter/program impact.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">b) Incident data shall be delivered in
accordance with the Department of Defense Cyber Crimes Center (DC3)
Instructions for Submitting Media available at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/pgi/docs/Instructions_for_Submitting_Media.docx.
In delivery of the incident data, the Contractor shall, to the extent
practical, remove contractor-owned information from Government covered
defense information.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">c) If the Contractor subsequently identifies
any such data not previously delivered to DC3, then the Contractor
shall immediately notify the contracting officer in writing and
shall deliver the incident data within ten (10) days of identification.
In such a case, the Contractor may request a delivery date later
than ten (10) days after identification. The contracting officer
will approve or disapprove the request after coordination with DC3.</p>
         <p class="p Normal"></p>
         <p class="p Normal"></p>
         <p class="p Normal">4. Naval Criminal Investigative Service
(NCIS) Outreach</p>
         <p class="p Normal">The Contractor shall engage with NCIS
industry outreach efforts and consider recommendations for hardening
of covered contractor information systems affecting DON programs
and technologies.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">5. NCIS/Industry Monitoring</p>
         <p class="p Normal">a) In the event of a cyber incident or
at any time the Government has indication of a vulnerability or
potential vulnerability, the Contractor shall cooperate with the
Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), which may include cooperation
related to: threat indicators; pre-determined incident information
derived from the Contractor's infrastructure systems; and the continuous
provision of all Contractor, subcontractor or vendor logs that show
network activity, including any additional logs the contractor,
subcontractor or vendor agrees to initiate as a result of the cyber
incident or notice of actual or potential vulnerability.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">b) If the Government determines that the
collection of all logs does not adequately protect its interests,
the Contractor and NCIS will work together to implement additional
measures, which may include allowing the installation of an appropriate
network device that is owned and maintained by NCIS, on the Contractor's
information systems or information technology assets. The specific
details (e.g., type of device, type of data gathered, monitoring
period) regarding the installation of an NCIS network device shall
be the subject of a separate agreement negotiated between NCIS and
the Contractor. In the alternative, the Contractor may install network
sensor capabilities or a network monitoring service, either of which
must be reviewed for acceptability by NCIS. Use of this alternative
approach shall also be the subject of a separate agreement negotiated
between NCIS and the Contractor.</p>
         <p class="p Normal">c) In all cases, the collection or provision
of data and any activities associated with this statement of work
shall be in accordance with federal, state, and non-US law.</p>
