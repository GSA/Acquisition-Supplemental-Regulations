- HCA</p>
                  <p class="p List1">(b) For the purposes of approving bridge

                  <p class="p Normal">206.303/206.304. If approval of the J&amp;A
negates consideration under SeaPort, see 5206.304 and</p>
                  <p class="p Normal">5206.305. This applies if the contract
for which a bridge is being sought would have been considered for
