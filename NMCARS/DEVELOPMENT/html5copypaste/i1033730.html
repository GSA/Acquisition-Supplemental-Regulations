of reclassification actions taken by the Government that render
GFM A&amp;E unserviceable, suspended or restricted, the Contractor
shall immediately follow the instructions contained within the notice.</p>
                  <p class="p List1">(d) When directed by the Government, the

shall be borne by the Contractor.</p>
                  <p class="p List1">(e) Within 30 days of completion or termination
of the contract, the Contractor shall request disposition instructions
from the Contracting Officer for any residual, unserviceable, suspended

shipment. Additionally, the Contractor shall notify the receiving
activity 30 days prior to shipment and provide a detailed list of

disposal of non-compliant or unauthorized shipments shall be borne
by the Contractor.</p>
                  <p class="p List1">(g) If the Contractor has the capability
to dispose of these materials at its facility and has been instructed
to do so through disposition instructions, the Contractor shall
provide written notice to the Contracting Officer identifying the
materials it is disposing of by the Contract Number, NSN or part
number, lot number, nomenclature and quantity, and the date the disposition
of the materials was accomplished.</p>
