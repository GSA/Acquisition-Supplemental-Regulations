         <p class="p Normalwithline">2.3.7 Discuss the use of category
management, including strategic sourcing. Address whether the requirement
can be achieved through an existing Federal, DOD, or DON contract
vehicle. If establishing a new contract vehicle when a similar solution
exists, include supporting information to justify why it is necessary
to meet the requirement. In addition, address category management tier
solutions and Analysis of Alternative (AoA) requirements, as defined
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum M-19-13,
