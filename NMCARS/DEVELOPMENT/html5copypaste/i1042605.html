the 10 U.S.C. 2533a requirement to buy certain articles from United
States sources and did not fall under any of the statutory exceptions.
Therefore, the implementing clause at [Delete one] 252.225-7012,
Preference for Certain Domestic Commodities / 252.225-7015, Restriction

         <p class="p Normal">1. Purpose</p>
         <p class="p Normal">The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate
whether ___________ of satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity,
and in the required form, can be procured as and when needed for
Contract ______________ in support of the ________ program or if any

the market research itself, only the analysis of alternatives is
necessary for this memo. Additionally, the information contained
herein may be contained in separate memos, if desired.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">2. Methodology Used in Market Research</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[Explain how the restricted items to be
acquired or any item of individual equipment containing the restricted
item(s) were identified and what the individual equipment items
are. Specify the restricted items involved to the degree possible.</p>

         <p class="p Normal">prime contractor or subcontractor for

         <p class="p Normal">3. Issues</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[Summarize issues investigated relative
to contractor’s assertion of non-availability. Examples are: predominant
industry location, status of industry in qualifying countries, alternative
materials/parts, US Government market share, cost of changes, Original
Equipment Manufacturer, Qualified Parts List, or any other qualification
required.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">4. Findings of Market Research</p>
         <p class="p Normal">a. Materials/Suppliers – [Discuss manufacturers
contacted, location of manufacturer and sources of supply, whether
the manufacturer can track the material or items to source, degree
of compliance/non-compliance asserted, willingness to analyze items for
compliance if not already known, any conclusions as to veracity
of compliance statements. If the manufacturer states its parts are
compliant but the sources of supply (vendors) contradict or undermine
this statement, this should be noted. If a manufacturer or supplier’s
interpretation of the material or item requirements is incorrect,
this should be noted. Examples of this would be an assumption that
reprocessing or dying of fibers, yarns, fabrics, or materials qualified
or that the small purchase exception is applicable at lower tiers
of subcontracting. If more than one type of restricted material
or item is involved in the DNAD, each should be treated in a separate
section.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">b. State of Industry – [Discuss research
done on the industry overall. This would include studies done by
other organizations, annual industry sales and the US Government
market share, information obtained from sources such as the Defense
Logistics Agency, Department of Commerce or National Association
of Manufacturers, internet surveys conducted, information obtained from
other DNADs, commercial aspects of the industry. Discuss what portion
of manufacturers and/or suppliers are represented in this document
and efforts to identify additional sources through means such as
notices in the Commerce Business Daily or Urgent Data Requests through
the Government Industry Data Exchange Program.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal">c. Other Issues – [Discuss any other issues
relevant to this DNAD such as logistics considerations or whether
an item is a critical capability for DOD].</p>
         <p class="p Normal">5. Alternatives Considered and Effects
of Compliance</p>
         <p class="p Normal">a. Material/part alternatives considered
and effects of compliance – [Explain the economic and schedule consequences
if compliance were mandated for the specific material/part. This
would include costs and time to build facilities, costs of insuring
compliant materials were segregated in the supply system, redesign
costs, or costs of any other alternatives considered.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal"></p>
         <p class="p Normal">b. Alternative Acquisition Strategies
Considered – [Explain any alternatives considered to buying the
noncompliant material/part. These alternatives may include considering
different end items to fulfill the requirement or using a different
component/part in the end item. Effects of alternatives in terms
of reengineering, delayed deliveries, mission impacts, etcetera,
should be explained. Address the price reasonableness of buying
compliant alternatives; can the price of the alternative be determined
to be fair and reasonable?].</p>
         <p class="p Normal">6. Recommendation/Signatures</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[Briefly, summarize conclusions and give
a recommendation. If analysis was performed by a support contractor
or an organization other than the requiring activity, signatures
should be identified to that organization/contractor and certification
of why alternatives are not acceptable should be provided as an
additional section or separate document].</p>
         <p class="p Normal">[If this analysis was performed by the
requiring activity, the certification as to why alternatives are
not acceptable should be included in this section along with the
requiring activity signatures.]</p>

Restricted end items are: aircraft; missile or space systems; ships;
tank or automotive items; weapon systems; ammunition; directly purchased
specialty metal (e.g., raw stock, including bar, billet, slab, wire,

unless such high performance magnets are incorporated into COTS
end items or subsystems; COTS fasteners, unless the fasteners are
incorporated into COTS end items, subsystems, or assemblies, or
the fasteners qualify for the commercial item exception.] This requirement
does not apply to the extent that the Secretary of the Navy determines
that end items containing compliant specialty metal of satisfactory

research and the Government’s analysis supporting the assertion

the determination that the price of the item to be acquired is fair
and reasonable. If the contracting officer determines that the price
would not be fair and reasonable, the Secretary of the military
department concerned may use that information in determining whether
the unreasonable price causes the compliant metal to be effectively
“nonavailable.” See DFARS PGI 225.7003-3 (b)(5)(A)) The market research
