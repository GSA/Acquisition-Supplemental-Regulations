                  <p class="p List1">(d) When evaluating proposed subcontracting
plans, contracting officers should obtain advice and recommendations
from the cognizant CAO, and shall do so for any subcontracting plan
that does not contain positive goals. The CAO should be specifically
requested to review the factors used by the prime contractor to
develop the zero goal, the past performance of the offeror on similar
requirements, and the current procedures used by the offeror to
maximize opportunities for small business, veteran-owned small business,
service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business,
small disadvantaged business and women-owned small business concerns
to participate in its subcontracting program. The contracting officer
shall consider the CAOâ€™s findings, including any recommendations,
prior to approval of the subcontracting plan. The contract file
shall be documented to reflect the review and the contracting officer's
final decision relative to an acceptable goal. If the contracting
officer determines that a subcontracting plan containing a zero
goal is appropriate, the determination shall be approved at a level
above the contracting officer and placed in the contract file.</p>
