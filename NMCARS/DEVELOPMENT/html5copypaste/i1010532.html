                  <p class="p List1">(a) General. DON HCAs are responsible
for establishing adequate and effective internal controls to carefully
manage and closely oversee the execution of delegated contracting
authority for assigned contracting mission functions. This includes proactively
working with requirements and program personnel during acquisition
planning to facilitate the timely submission of requirements to
the appropriate contracting activity for contract action in a manner
which promotes and permits maximum competition. In conjunction with
executing assigned contracting missions, there are certain types
of procurements for which authority resides solely with the DON
HCA as described in paragraph (c) below, unless authority is delegated
in writing to another DON HCA and accepted by the receiving DON
HCA to execute those procurements. Delegation of DON contracting
authority applies only within the DON. Requirements executed outside
of the DON shall follow the appropriate governing rules/regulations/policies
(e.g., The Economy Act, Assisted Acquisition, FAR Part 17). At a
minimum, DON HCAs shall address the following requirements and how
they will be met in the contracting activity’s procedures for delegation
of contracting authority:</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(1) Tracking of all contracting authority
that has been delegated and any limitations on the contracting authority.</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(2) Tracking of delegations received from
HCAs.</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(3) Activities shall provide DASN(P) a
listing of delegations issued on an annual basis in the format provided
at Annex 11. Activities shall submit the template in Annex 11, Delegation
of Contracting Authority Annual Report, by email at Policy@navy.mil
with the subject “NMCARS 5201.601-90 – Contracting Authority Delegation
Approval Annual Report” not later than January 30th of each year
for the previous calendar year.</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(4) Ensuring contracting authority delegations
are made, in writing from DON HCA to DON HCA, without power of redelegation,
to include:</p>
                  <p class="p List4">(A) Documenting the rationale supporting
the delegation and address why the delegation is necessary for the
efficient and proper administration of the receiving DON HCA’s contracting
operations.</p>
                  <p class="p List4">(B) The requirement that the DON HCA receiving
the delegated authority affirmatively acknowledge and accept the
conditions of the delegation in writing prior to exercising the
delegated authority.</p>
                  <p class="p List4">(C) The extent to which the HCA delegated
authority may be redelegated to contracting offices not under the
cognizance of the receiving HCA unless specifically requested.</p>
                  <p class="p List4">(D) Ensuring the delegated contracting
authority is being executed and administered in accordance with
the delegation of authority and contracting regulations, rules,
and procedures.</p>
                  <p class="p List1">(b) HCA responsibilities and limitations.
Each HCA is solely responsible for executing its delegated contracting
authority for assigned acquisition programs and cognizant areas
of responsibilities subject to any established limitation. An HCA has
authority to procure supplies and services to support all organic
requirements, such as those set forth in SECNAVINST 5400.15, unless

               <div class="body conbody">
                  <p class="p List1">(a) The primary objective of procurement
management oversight is to validate sound contracting practices
throughout the DON. This oversight encourages and assists HCAs in
making continuous improvements in their acquisition and procurement
processes. It also provides a mechanism for sharing "best practices"
throughout the DON. Procurement management oversight in the DON
is conducted through the Procurement Performance Management Assessment
Program (PPMAP). The PPMAP is a flexible, performance-based, process-oriented
program that requires contracting activities to perform periodic
self-assessments of:</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(1) critical procurement processes used
to manage and execute procurement operations within the HCA, including
their associated outcomes;</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(2) performance-based metrics; and,</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(3) the results of employee and customer
surveys.</p>
                  <p class="p List1">(b) The HCA will use the results of these
self-assessments to:</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(1) evaluate the quality of its procurement
processes and management systems;</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(2) validate execution of delegated authority
is occurring according to law and regulation;</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(3) mitigate risk of vulnerabilities for
fraud, waste or abuse to occur; and,</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(4) take appropriate corrective actions,
as needed, to improve or maintain the quality of procurement operations
within the contracting activity.</p>

               <div class="body conbody">
                  <p class="p List1">(a) DASN(P) is responsible for
managing and overseeing the performance of the DON contracting/procurement
system by reviewing HCAs and other designated DON contracting organizations
using the PPMAP as one of its primary methods to execute this responsibility.
DASN(P) is also responsible for providing PPMAP guidance, as appropriate.</p>
                  <p class="p List1">(b) Each HCA is responsible for performing
management and oversight reviews of all procurement operations performed within
the HCA, i.e. within Headquarters and at any subordinate contracting
organization or field activity with delegated procurement authority,
for procurement operations associated with any delegated authority,
and at any other activities as directed by DASN(P) or higher-level
authority. HCAs shall:</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(1) establish written procedures implementing
the DON PPMAP review process for the contracting activity;</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(2) perform and document periodic self-assessments
(and other internal reviews) to evaluate and improve the quality
of the procurement organization’s operations and processes within
the contracting activity; and,</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(3) conduct and document timely reviews
of all subordinate organizations and field activities with delegated
contracting/procurement authority to ensure execution of authority
is performed according to law and regulation.</p>
                  <p class="p List1">(c) HCAs will, upon request, provide contracting
personnel, at a grade of GS-14 (or equivalent) or higher, to serve
on DASN(P) PPMAP teams.</p>
                  <p class="p List1">(d) Reporting requirements. HCAs shall
provide DASN(P) the following information:</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(1) By October 1st of each year, submit
a PPMAP assessment plan for the new fiscal year identifying the
self-assessments and activity reviews scheduled for the contracting
activity, including the specific resources (by activity) that will
be assigned to conduct that oversight.</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(2) By January 30th of each year, submit
a report summarizing for the contracting activity the outcome of
the previous fiscal year’s periodic self-assessments/internal compliance
reviews performed on the contracting/procurement function at Headquarters
and of on-site reviews/assessments conducted on subordinate contracting
organizations and field activities with delegated procurement authority.
The annual report should clearly convey the actions the HCA has
taken to improve the quality of contracting/procurement operations
within the contracting activity. At a minimum, the HCA’s report
must:</p>
                  <p class="p List3">(i) include a summary of the findings noted
for the contracting activity;</p>
                  <p class="p List3">(ii) describe any statutory and/or regulatory
deficiencies identified;</p>
                  <p class="p List3">(iii) explain associated corrective actions
taken either at the contracting activity-level or specific subordinate
field activity-level;</p>
                  <p class="p List3">(iv) identify best practices which could
be useful to other DON contracting activities;</p>
                  <p class="p List3">(v) include other relevant information,
i.e. the results of the HCA’s annual warrant file audits, acquisition
staffing and workload analysis, external audits or reviews to include
the status of relevant recommendations; and, if applicable,</p>
                  <p class="p List3">(vi) address the actions taken in response
to a DASN(P) PPMAP performed during the reporting period.</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(3) Submit the required information in
paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) above to DASN(P) by e-mail at https://psctool.us
with the subject “[Activity Name] NMCARS 5201.691-2 – PPMAP Reporting.”
Reports must be signed by the HCA’s senior contracting official.</p>
                  <p class="p List1">(e) DASN(P) shall be advised in writing,
within five calendar days, any time an HCA revokes, suspends or
reduces contracting or purchase card authority delegated to a cognizant
field contracting activity or subordinate organization. Submit notifications
to DASN(P) by e-mail at https://psctool.us with the subject “[Activity
Name] NMCARS 5201.691-2 –Revocation of [Contracting or Purchase
Card] Authority.”</p>
