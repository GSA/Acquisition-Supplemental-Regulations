focused on and their technical and production capabilities. ABC
Division representatives maintain this knowledge through routine
review of industry journals and attendance at industry symposia
and conferences. They also periodically visit industry facilities
for briefings on companies' IR&amp;D efforts. Based on its knowledge and
expertise, ABC Division has determined that no companies other than
RST Corporation have the knowledge and technical capability required
to provide the XYZ-24</p>

         <p class="p List3">(v) Members of activity's technical, logistics
and contracting community outside the contiguous United States conduct market
research on a continual basis. Annually they visit each site where
system maintenance and component repairs are performed. During these
visits, they meet with local contractors and on-site government
representatives to review current capabilities and potential changes
in system maintenance/repair requirements. Based on information
gathered during their most recent visits, the activity outside the
contiguous United States has determined that only the current contractors
are capable of meeting the Navy's requirements. A synopsis of these
planned contracts has not been published. In accordance with FAR
5.202(a)(12), a synopsis is not required when the contract action
is by a Defense agency and the proposed contract action will be
made and performed outside the United States and its outlying areas,
and only local sources will be solicited.</p>

technical data package, such actions might include, for example,
development of a performance specification, use of reverse engineering
to develop a second source or, after justifying noncompetitive procurement
of emergency supplies/services on the basis of unusual and compelling
urgency, using competition to award contract vehicles for requirements
at quantities greater than the emergent need, or for similar items
if needed to meet future emergency situations.]</p>

supplies or services to be acquired including quantities by fiscal
year for major items, the total estimated value of the contract,

         <p class="p Normal">Example: This J&amp;A covers award of
a contract to ABC Aircraft Company, a fully owned subsidiary of
DEF Company, for the SDD phase of the XYZ Program. This effort will
include the design and development of an air vehicle, including
two Ground Test Vehicles and five Engineering Development models,
testing, engineering studies and related supplies and services.
The estimated total value of the contract is $X,XB and will be funded
with FY06 through FY11 RDT&amp;E funds. The planned contract is
supported by NAVAIR Acquisition Strategy 050-03-01, approved by
USD(AT&amp;L) on SEP 5, 2005.</p>

         <p class="p Normal">Example: This J&amp;A covers award of
a contract to LGI Corporation for performance-based logistics support
of the EFG system. The contract will include a three-year base period
and four one-year options. Total estimated value of the contract
is $123M and will be funded with Navy Working Capital Funds (NWCF).
The J&amp;A is consistent with NAVICP STRAP Plan No. 12345, approved
July 8, 2005 by PEO(ABC).</p>

         <p class="p Normal">[In a few sentences, summarize the rationale
set forth in Paragraph 5 of the J&amp;A for using other than full
and open competition. Address other information necessary to provide
a context for the procurement and facilitate understanding of the
proposed business approach. Additional information might explain,
for example, that:</p>
         <p class="p Normal"></p>
         <p class="p Normal">the planned contract is a final buyout
of the requirement,</p>
         <p class="p Normal">the sole source was determined through
a prior competitive down-selection,</p>
         <p class="p Normal">under a prior contract the program experienced
significant cost savings when it broke out the requirements covered

         <p class="p Normal">the contractor plans to integrate work
under the contract with a commercial production line, or</p>
         <p class="p Normal">the contractor plans to enter into a partnering
arrangement with another firm or Government entity for highly specialized requirements.]</p>
         <p class="p Normal"></p>
         <p class="p Normal">Example: PRP is the sole designer, developer
and manufacturer of the XX-46 series radar system and is the only
contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience and technical
data that can meet the Government’s requirements on a timely basis.</p>

         <p class="p Normal">Example: MN Corporation is the sole designer,
developer and manufacturer of the F-XX-416 series engines and is
the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience and
technical data that can provide the required performance-based logistics support
for these engines. Until 2001, MN supported these engines as a subcontractor
to the prime contractor for the entire F-112 aircraft support contract.
Breaking out this portion of the total system effort resulted in
a 22% reduction in F-XX-416 engine support costs.</p>

         <p class="p Normal">Example: The J&amp;A cites 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)
as the statutory exception justifying use of other than full and
open competition. This exception applies when <span class="ph ptext-2">it is necessary to award the contract
to a particular source in order</span>
