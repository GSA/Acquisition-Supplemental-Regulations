Since claims by contractors often involve difficult and complex
legal, factual and financial issues requiring extensive factfinding
or analysis to determine whether or not the Government is liable,
a multi-disciplined team should generally be established to analyze
the claim.</p>

officer shall promptly formalize such constructive change(s) in
writing as soon as the parties have negotiated an acceptable adjustment

the contract contains the clause at FAR 52.2437, Notification of
Changes.</p>
                  <p class="p List2">(2) In exceptional cases where disruption,
delay or other claimed impacts are known to exist and cannot be
currently resolved, the contracting activity may proceed with equitable
adjustments covering the interrelated formal changes coupled with
usage or qualified release. The qualified release should specifically
identify the interrelationship with the contractor's claim such
as delay or disruption impacts reserving to the contractor the right
to pursue and demonstrate support for a separate equitable adjustment
therefore under the contract.</p>

time" approaches are considered only as a last resort. A contractor
(claimant) filing a total cost or total time-based claim should
establish that there is no other feasible, acceptable basis for

there is no way of correlating government actions and omissions
to historical cost elements or even to reasonable substantiated
cost estimates.</p>

to DASN(P) with respect to claim settlements or final decisions
of a contracting officer shall include a legal memorandum. As a
minimum the required legal memorandum should:</p>
               <p class="p List2">(1) Analyze the applicability and adequacy
of the contractor's legal theory or theories of Government liability;</p>
               <p class="p List2">(2) Analyze and evaluate the presence and
adequacy of evidentiary facts satisfying the elements of proof required
by such legal theory or theories;</p>

fraud, release, laches, statute of limitations; and</p>

may be made prior to obtaining the required approval.</p>
               <p class="p List1">(d) Primary emphasis should be given to
achieving prompt settlement of claims, thereby obviating need for
provisional price increases or payments. Provisional price increases
or provisional payments against contractor claims may be made when the
following documents have been obtained:</p>
               <p class="p List2">(1) A legal determination that the contractor
is entitled to compensation.</p>
               <p class="p List2">(2) Sufficient technical, administrative,

is entitlement and that the amount of ultimate entitlement to compensation
will equal or exceed the amount of the provisional price increase
or provisional payment.</p>
               <p class="p List1">(e) When a provisional payment, either
individually or cumulatively against a single claim exceeds $25

               <p class="p List1">(a) General. The Office of the
General Counsel (OGC) has sole litigation authority for all appeals
under DON contracts to the ASBCA. Because of the frequent complexity
of these cases, the OGC and the contracting activity involved should maintain
the continuity of any DON claim team that might have investigated
and evaluated the contractor's claim submission. Such teams should
continue to function in an assisting capacity under the leadership
of the OGC Trial Attorney assigned to handle the appeal.</p>
               <p class="p List1">(b) Litigation report requirement. With
the compilation of Rule 4 documents, a comprehensive litigation
report shall be forwarded to the Litigation Division. The report
should include:</p>
               <p class="p List2">(1) A detailed narrative statement of facts,
preferably in chronological sequence, and with a topical segregation
when appropriate, with references to attached supporting documents
of expected testimony. If such a statement was previously submitted,
it need not be submitted a second time, but should be supplemented
or revised if additional information becomes available in the interim.</p>
               <p class="p List2">(2) An analysis and evaluation (classified
as attorneyclient privileged information) of the factual and legal
positions of both sides (including affirmative defenses and counterclaims
available to the Government), the available evidence, and the expertise
and effectiveness of prospective witnesses.</p>
               <p class="p List2">(3) The advisory report, if any, of the
reviewing official or board.</p>
               <p class="p List1">(c) Settlement negotiations pending appeal.
The conduct of settlement negotiations in connection with any pending
appeal should generally be accomplished by a selected team consisting
of the trial attorney and representatives of the contracting officer
(including contracting activity technical personnel, counsel, negotiator,
and auditor if necessary). Other arrangements may be made in specific
cases as appropriate. However, no final settlement agreement will
be made without the written approval of the contracting officer.
When a settlement is made, a memorandum shall be prepared by the
negotiating team (and signed by all team members) stating the basis
and reasons. The settlement agreement shall be drafted by the contracting
activity and trial attorney. The trial attorney shall file any legal
papers required to be filed with the ASBCA to effect disposition
of the case by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
               <p class="p List1">(d) Review and approval. Negotiated settlements
of appeals pending before the ASBCA, as well as negotiated settlements of
appeal issues that have been remanded to the DON for quantum determination,
will be subject to review and approval at levels established for
claims of the same dollar amount.</p>
               <p class="p List1">(e) Contract modification. Whenever contract
modification and other contract documents are required to implement
a settlement of ASBCA or appellate court decision, they should reference
the ASBCA proceedings by title and docket number.</p>
