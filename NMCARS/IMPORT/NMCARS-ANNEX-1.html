<p class="List1"><em>Examples</em>: (<em>i) The proposed contract was synopsized on the Beta.SAM website on July 6, 2005</em></p>
<p class="pindented1"><em>and only EFG Corporation expressed an interest in this requirement.  No additional market research was conducted because it is not practicable, for the reasons discussed in paragraph 5 above, for any company other than EFG to provide the required supplies and services.  </em></p>
<p class="List3">(ii) <em>The proposed contract was synopsized on the Beta.SAM website on July 6, 2005.  In </em></p>
<p><em>addition to EFG Corporation, responses were received from BBCC Company and from AGW Ltd.  Representatives of the Program Office and the contracting officer held discussions with BBCC and AGW.  Subsequently, both companies, based on a better understanding of the Navy's requirements, indicated in writing they were no longer interested in pursuing a prime contract.  No additional market research was conducted because it is not practicable, for the reasons discussed in paragraph 5 above, for any company other than EFG to provide the required supplies and services.  </em></p>
<p class="List3"><em>(iii) The proposed contract was synopsized on the Beta.SAM website on July 6, 2005 and no </em></p>
<p class="pindented1"><em>other potential sources expressed an interest in this requirement.  In an effort to identify competitive interest, the Naval ABC Command, Industrial Sources Division, as part of their market research, provides more than 850 commercial entities, on an annual basis, a listing of items for which it is seeking competitive sources, as well as instructions for obtaining source approval information.  Additionally, the availability of the listing is periodically publicized in </em></p>
<p><em>Beta.SAM and feedback is requested regarding market capabilities.  To date, no other </em></p>
<p class="pindented1"><em>companies have expressed interest in becoming qualified to compete for the items to be acquired under the proposed contract.  </em></p>
<p class="List3"><em>(iv) NAVCOM's ABC Division, the Navy's Center of Excellence for XYZ systems, maintains in-depth knowledge of XYZ technology developments and the XYZ industrial base.  This includes insight into technologies that individual companies are focused on and their technical and production capabilities.  ABC Division representatives maintain this knowledge through routine review of industry journals and attendance at industry symposia and conferences.  They also periodically visit industry facilities for briefings on companies' IR&amp;D efforts.  Based on its knowledge and expertise, ABC Division has determined that no companies other than RST Corporation have the knowledge and technical capability required to provide the XYZ-24</em></p>
<p><em>systems.  The lack of any responses to a synopsis of the planned contract published on the </em></p>
<p><em>Beta.SAM website on June 5, 2005 validates ABC Division's determination.</em></p>
<p class="List3"><em>(v) Members of activity's technical, logistics and contracting community outside the contiguous United States conduct market research on a continual basis.  Annually they visit each site where system maintenance and component repairs are performed.  During these visits, they meet with local contractors and on-site government representatives to review current capabilities and potential changes in system maintenance/repair requirements.  Based on information gathered during their most recent visits, the activity outside the contiguous United States has determined that only the current contractors are capable of meeting the Navy's requirements.  A synopsis of these planned contracts has not been published.  In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(12), a synopsis is not required when the contract action is by a Defense agency and the proposed contract action will be made and performed outside the United States and its outlying areas, and only local sources will be solicited.  </em></p>
<p class="pindented1">7. <em>Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost</em>. The Contracting Officer has determined the anticipated cost to the Government of the supplies/services covered by this J&amp;A will be fair and reasonable. </p>
<p class="pindented1"><strong>[Once this determination is made, paragraph 7 need only contain</strong><span style="color:#FF0000 !important"><strong> </strong></span><strong>the above statement.  No additional information is required.]</strong></p>
<p class="pindented1">8. <em>Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition</em>.</p>
<p class="pindented1"><strong>[If there is currently no reasonable likelihood of future competition, use the following or similar language: </strong></p>
<p class="pindented1">For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, NAVSYSCOM has no plans at this time to compete future contacts for the types of supplies/services covered by this document. If another potential source emerges, NAVSYSCOM will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible.<strong>]</strong> </p>
<p class="pindented1"><strong>[Discuss any actions the activity plans to take to change conditions that would preclude the use of full and open competition for acquiring the same or similar supplies or services in the future.  In addition to acquiring a validated technical data package, such actions might include, for example, development of a performance specification, use of reverse engineering to develop a second source or, after justifying noncompetitive procurement of emergency supplies/services on the basis of unusual and compelling urgency, using competition to award contract vehicles for requirements at quantities greater than the emergent need, or for similar items if needed to meet future emergency situations.]  </strong></p>
<p class="pindented1"><strong>[If future competition is planned, provide the estimated date of the first competitive acquisition.  If this is a one-time buy or a final buyout, so state.]</strong></p>
<p class="pindented1"><strong>[If the Government anticipates acquiring a technical data package or developing a performance specification that will support competition, use the following or similar language:  </strong></p>
<p class="pindented1">The Government (or Program Office) expects to obtain a technical data package or develop a performance specification that will support competition for future acquisitions of the same or similar items.<strong>]</strong> </p>

<p><em>SUBJECT</em><strong><em>: [ACTIVITY NAME] </em></strong><em>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL</em><strong><em> [NUMBER]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>        </em></strong><em>FOR</em><strong><em> [TOP-LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>        COVERED BY THE J&amp;A]</em></strong></p>
<p> Example: NAVAL SEA SYSTEMS COMMAND JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL</p>
<p> (J&amp;A) 22567 FOR LEAD YARD SERVICES FOR VIRGINIA CLASS SUBMARINES</p>
<p>ASN(RDA) approval is required for the J&amp;A <strong>[or state CJ&amp;A, if applicable] </strong>at Tab A.</p>
<p><strong>[Briefly describe what the J&amp;A covers, in terms of the type of contract action(s) involved,</strong></p>
<p><strong>the identity of the planned contractor[s],the supplies or services to be acquired including quantities by fiscal year for major items, the total estimated value of the contract, with funding summary, and identification of the planning document (e.g., the Streamlined Acquisition Plan (STRAP)/Strategy) that supports the procurement.  If none, explain why not.]</strong></p>
<p><em>Example:  This J&amp;A covers award of a contract to ABC Aircraft Company, a fully owned subsidiary of DEF Company, for the SDD phase of the XYZ Program.  This effort will include the design and development of an air vehicle, including two Ground Test Vehicles and five Engineering Development models, testing, engineering studies and related supplies and services.  The estimated total value of the contract is $X,XB and will be funded with FY06 through FY11 RDT&amp;E funds.  The planned contract is supported by NAVAIR Acquisition Strategy 050-03-01, approved by USD(AT&amp;L) on SEP 5, 2005.</em></p>
<p><em>Example:  This J&amp;A covers award of a contract to LGI Corporation for performance-based logistics support of the EFG system.  The contract will include a three-year base period and four one-year options.  Total estimated value of the contract is $123M and will be funded with Navy Working Capital Funds (NWCF).  The J&amp;A is consistent with NAVICP STRAP Plan No. 12345, approved July 8, 2005 by PEO(ABC).</em> </p>
<p><strong>[In a few sentences, summarize the rationale set forth in Paragraph 5 of the J&amp;A for using other than full and open competition.  Address other information necessary to provide a context for the procurement and facilitate understanding of the proposed business approach.</strong> <strong>Additional information might explain, for example, that:  </strong></p>
<p><strong>the planned contract is a final buyout of the requirement, </strong></p>
<p><strong>the sole source was determined through a prior competitive down-selection, </strong></p>
<p><strong>under a prior contract the program experienced significant cost savings when it broke out the requirements covered by the planned contract from a larger system integration contract, </strong></p>
<p><strong>the contractor plans to integrate work under the contract with a commercial production line, or </strong></p>
<p><strong>the contractor plans to enter into a partnering arrangement with another firm or Government entity for highly specialized requirements.<em>]</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>Example: </em> <em>PRP is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the XX-46 series radar system and is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience and technical data that can meet the Government&rsquo;s requirements on a timely basis. </em></p>
<p><em>Example:</em> <em>MN Corporation is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the F-XX-416 series engines and is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience and technical data that can provide the required performance-based logistics support for these engines.  Until 2001, MN supported these engines as a subcontractor to the prime contractor for the entire F-112 aircraft support contract.  Breaking out this portion of the total system effort resulted in a 22% reduction in F-XX-416 engine support costs.  </em></p>
<p><em>Example:</em> <em>The J&amp;A cites 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3) as the statutory exception justifying use of other than full and open competition.  This exception applies when </em><span style="color:#000000 !important"><em>it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source in order to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC).  As a FFRDC, CNA </em></span><em>is uniquely qualified to provide these services because of its unquestioned objectivity and lack of potential conflicts of interest, its confidentiality in protecting very sensitive military and intelligence information, its familiarity with the needs of the Navy and Marine Corps, and its establishment of a continuing research agenda for the Navy and Marine Corps.  </em></p>
<p>[<strong>Briefly explain any differences between information included in the J&amp;A and information in the supporting Acquisition Strategy/Plan and explain the rationale for these differences.  Pay particular attention to differences in quantities and funding levels.  Also, note any significant congressional or other programmatic issues.  These may include, for example: </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>pending legislation that could impact the procurement,</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>known congressional concerns with the acquisition strategy, or</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>recent test results that might delay the program.</em>]</strong></p>
<p>Example:<em>  </em>Last month, the PEO/PM met with Senator Smith's staff to discuss the feasibility of using the XYZ system to meet our requirements in lieu of the ABC system. Although the PM provided a detailed explanation of why this would not be feasible, it's possible that Senator Smith will contact you directly to discuss this subject further. The PM is prepared to provide you with a briefing, as necessary. </p>
<p><strong>[Identify point of contact information for the PEO, PM, and PCO including name, phone number and email address.]</strong></p>
<p>RECOMMENDATION: Approve J&amp;A <strong>[or CJ&amp;A, if applicable]</strong> at Tab A.</p>
