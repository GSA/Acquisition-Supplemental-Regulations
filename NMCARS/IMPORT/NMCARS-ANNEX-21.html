<p><strong>Section 1. Requirements Development and Management</strong></p>
<p>1.1 <em>Statement of Need. </em>Describe the requirement, its source, the outcomes to be achieved and, if performance based, the metrics to measure the outcomes. In your description of the product or service, explain the choice of product or service description code ensuring it aligns with the DOD taxonomy associated with the acquisition of services, supplies and equipment. (See USD(ATL) memorandum entitled, &ldquo;Taxonomy for the Acquisition of Services and Supplies &amp;</p>
<p> Equipment&rdquo; dated August 27, 2012.) </p>
<p>1.2 <em>Historical Summary.  </em>Identify how the requirement was previously satisfied or identify it as a new requirement. </p>
<p>1.3 <em>Market Research. </em>Discuss how market research was performed and the results.</p>
<p>1.4 <em>Bundling/Consolidation. </em>Discuss the impact of any bundling or consolidation that might affect small business participation in the acquisition. When the proposed acquisition strategy involves bundling, identify the incumbent contractors and contracts affected by the bundling. </p>
<p>1.5 <em>Technical Data.</em> Discuss the requirements for contractor data (including repurchase data) and data rights, their estimated cost, and the use to be made of the data. Explain how the use of the technical data and data rights will be used to sustain competition.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2. Acquisition Planning</strong></p>
<p>2.1. <em>Acquisition Approach. </em>Discuss the acquisition approach including appropriate milestones, </p>
<p>including actual or anticipated SRRB approval. If the requirements include services specified in Annex 22 but not covered by an exception listed at 5237.102, discuss how SeaPort was considered. </p>
<p>2.2 <em>Budget. </em>Identify the estimated cost for each option/phase for acquisitions that contemplate the use of options or a multiple phased approach. Explain how budget estimates were derived and discuss the schedule for obtaining adequate funds at the time they are required. </p>
<p>2.3 <em>Funding. </em>Identify funding to support the action by fiscal year and appropriation.</p>
<p>2.4 <em>Category Management/Strategic Sourcing. </em>Describe how category management, including strategic sourcing, will be considered for incorporation into this acquisition. Address whether the requirement can be achieved through an existing Federal, DOD, or DON contract vehicle. If establishing a new contract vehicle when a similar solution exists, include supporting information to justify why it is necessary to meet the requirement. In addition, address category management Tier solutions and Analysis of Alternative (AoA) requirements, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum M-19-13, for all common requirements.</p>
<p>2.5 <em>Performance-based Acquisition. </em>Discuss the use of performance-based acquisition methods or rationale for not using performance-based methods. </p>

<p>2.7 <em>Source-selection procedures.</em> Explain the type of source selection procedure being contemplated (i.e., Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA), Price/Technical Tradeoff or Value Adjusted Total Evaluated Price (VATEP)) in the evaluation of proposals and source selection. Discuss why the choice is appropriate and in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>2.8 <em>Deviations. </em>Discuss any applicable FAR or DFARS deviations that will be required.</p>
<p>2.9 <em>Competition. </em>Describe how competition will be sought, promoted, and sustained throughout the course of the acquisition.

<p><strong>Section 3. Solicitation and Contract Award</strong></p>
<p>3.1 <em>Contract type selection. </em>Discuss the rationale for the selection of contract type. Provide an analysis of why the use of that contract type is appropriate (e.g., complexity of the requirements, uncertain duration of the work, contractor&rsquo;s technical capability and financial responsibility, or adequacy of the contractor&rsquo;s accounting system). Discuss the opportunity to transition from cost type to fixed priced contracts, if applicable. Provide rationale if procuring services that are performance-based and a contract type other than a firm-fixed price is contemplated.</p>
