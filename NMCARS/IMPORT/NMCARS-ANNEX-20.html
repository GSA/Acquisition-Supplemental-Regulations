<p><strong>Section 2:  Acquisition Considerations. </strong></p>
<p>2.1 <em>Product or Services Description.</em> </p>
<p>2.1.1 In your description of the product or service, explain the choice of product or service description code ensuring it aligns with the DOD taxonomy associated with the acquisition of services, supplies and equipment. (See USD(ATL) memorandum entitled, &ldquo;Taxonomy for the Acquisition of Services and Supplies &amp; Equipment&rdquo; dated August 27, 2012). DPC provides the PSC Selection Tool, available at https://psctool.us to assist in the correct PSC selection.</p>
<p>2.1.2 Specify the required capabilities or performance characteristics of the supplies or the performance standards of the services being acquired. Address whether the supplies to be acquired are critical items (as defined in FAR 46.101) and whether higher-level quality standards are necessary. For IT Services, discuss any cybersecurity requirements that are inconsistent with DOD policies.</p>
<p>2.1.3 Describe the basis for and factors considered in establishing delivery schedule or period of performance. Include the rationale for the appropriate period of performance relative to the type of Services procurement.</p>

<p>2.3.6.2 Consideration of requirements for efficient manufacture during the design and production of the systems to be procured under the program.</p>
<p>2.3.6.3 The use of advanced manufacturing technology, processes, and systems during the research and development phase and the production phase of the program.</p>
<p>2.3.6.4 To the maximum extent practicable, the use of contract solicitations that encourage competing offerors to acquire, for use in the performance of the contract, modern technology, production equipment, and production systems (including hardware and software) that increase the productivity of the offerors and reduce the life-cycle costs.</p>
<p>2.3.6.5 Methods to encourage investment by U.S. domestic sources in advanced manufacturing technology production equipment and processes through&mdash;</p>
<p>(a) Recognition of the contractor&rsquo;s investment in advanced manufacturing technology production equipment, processes, and organization of work systems that build on workers&rsquo; skill and experience, and work force skill development in the development of the contract objective; and</p>
<p>(b) Increased emphasis in source selection on the efficiency of production.</p>

<p>2.3.6.11<span style="color:#000000 !important">&nbsp;Assess the long-term technical data and computer software needs of those systems and subsystems and establish an acquisition strategy that provides for the technical data and computer software deliverables and associated license rights needed to sustain those systems and subsystems over their life cycle. The strategy may include&mdash;</span></p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of maintenance capabilities within DOD; or </p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition for contracts for sustainment of the systems or subsystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.3.6.12 Include a plan for the preservation and storage of special tooling associated with the production of hardware for MDAPs through the end of the service life of the related weapons system. The plan shall include the identification of any contract clauses, facilities, and funding required for the preservation and storage of such tooling.</p>
<p>2.3.7 Discuss the use of category management, including strategic sourcing. Address whether the requirement can be achieved through an existing Federal, DOD, or DON contract vehicle.

<p>2.4.5.2 For services contracts with a period of performance longer than 5 years, discuss the use of on-ramps and off-ramps (entry and exit points), if applicable, to ensure the availability and viability of a qualified pool of contractors. </p>
<p>2.5 <em>Contract type selection.</em> </p>
<p>2.5.1 Discuss the rationale for the selection of contract type. Provide an analysis of why the use of that contract type is appropriate (e.g., complexity of the requirements, uncertain duration of the work, contractor&rsquo;s technical capability and financial responsibility, or adequacy of the contractor&rsquo;s accounting system). Discuss the opportunity to transition from cost type to fixed priced contracts, if applicable. Provide rationale if procuring services that are performance-based and a contract type other than a firm-fixed price is contemplated.</p>
