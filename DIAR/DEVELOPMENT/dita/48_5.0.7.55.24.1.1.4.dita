         <p outputclass="List2">(3) A contracting activity other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs where the work to be performed is specifically for the benefit of Indians and is in addition to any incidental benefits which might otherwise accrue to the general public.

         <p outputclass="List1">(b) The CO shall insert the clause at 1452.226-71, Indian Preference Program - Department of the Interior, in all solicitations issued and contracts awarded by a contracting activity which may exceed $50,000, which contain the clause required by paragraph (a) of this section and where it is determined by the CO, prior to solicitation, that the work under the contract will be performed in whole or in part on or near an Indian reservation(s). The Indian Preference Program clause may also be included in solicitations issued and contracts awarded by a contracting activity which may not exceed $50,000, but which contain the clause required by paragraph (a) of this section and which, in the opinion of the CO, offer substantial opportunities for Indian employment, training or subcontracting.
