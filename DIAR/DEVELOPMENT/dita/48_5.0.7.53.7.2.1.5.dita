      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) If other than full and open competition is recommended by the office initiating an acquisition requirement, the recommendation shall:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) Be in writing;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) Accompany the requisition;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) Contain the information required by FAR 6.303-2; and
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(4) Request the CO to conduct a market survey by issuing a synopsis of the proposed contract action (see 1405.207). The initiating office shall evaluate and document all responses to the notice. The CO shall prepare the D&amp;F that only one source can meet the Government's needs based on the evaluation results. The evaluation results shall be included in the justification as required by FAR 6.303-2(a)(8) if it is determined that only one source can meet the Government's needs.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) The procedure in paragraph (a) of this section is not required for proposed contract actions to be awarded under the authority in FAR 6.302-2 when the CO determines that preparation and approval of the justification would unreasonably delay the acquisition. Under these circumstances, a justification may be prepared and approved after award in accordance with FAR 6.303-1(d).
