         <p outputclass="P">This subpart sets forth the texts of all DIAR provisions and clauses. Consistent with the numbering scheme prescribed in FAR 52.101 and the approach used in FAR Subpart 52.2, this subpart is arranged by subject matter, in the same order as, and keyed to, the parts of the DIAR in which provisions and clause requirements are addressed.
