<p><a name="P64_9731"></a><b>1480.302   Restrictions on use of the Buy Indian Act.</b></p>

<p>(a) IA must not use the authority of the Buy Indian Act and the procedures contained in this part to award intergovernmental contracts to tribal organizations to plan, operate or administer authorized IA programs (or parts thereof) that are within the scope and intent of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. IA must use the Buy Indian Act solely to award procurement contracts to IEEs.</p>

<p>(b) IA must not use the authority of this Act for construction contracts, as defined in FAR 36.102, unless the construction is covered construction, as defined in <font color="#0000ff"><a href="1480.htm#P32_2610"><u>1480.201</u></a></font>.</p>

<p><a name="P68_10388"></a><b>1480.401   Requirement to give preference to Indian economic enterprises.</b></p>

<p>(a) IA must use the negotiation authority of the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, to give preference to Indians whenever the use of that authority is authorized and practicable. The Buy Indian Act provides that, “so far as may be practicable, Indian labor shall be employed, and purchases of the products (including, but not limited to printing, notwithstanding any other law) of Indian industry may be made in open market at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.” Thus, IA may use the Buy Indian Act to give preference to IEEs through set-asides when acquiring supplies, services, and covered construction to meet IA needs and requirements. IA must contract for covered construction in accordance with <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR36.doc. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/36.htm#TopOfPage"><u>FAR Part 36</u></a></font>.</p>

<p>(b) IA or any other bureau or office of the Department of the Interior delegated the authority to make acquisitions under the Buy Indian Act may not use the Buy Indian Act to give preference to IEEs through set-asides when acquiring construction that is not covered construction.</p>

<p>(c) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the awarding of contracts under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b et seq.) by the Department of the Interior.</p>

<p><a name="P72_11671"></a><b>1480.402   Delegations and responsibility.</b></p>

<p>(a) The Secretary has delegated authority under the Buy Indian Act to the Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs. IA exercises this authority in support of its mission and program activities and as a means of fostering Indian employment and economic development.</p>

<p>(b) The Secretary may delegate authority under the Buy Indian Act to a bureau or office within the Department of the Interior other than IA only in accordance with the Departmental Manual.</p>

<p>(c) As the head of the contracting activity, the CFO is responsible for ensuring that all IA acquisitions under the Buy Indian Act comply with the requirements of this part.</p>

<p>(2) IA may consider termination for default if it is determined to be in the best interest of the government.</p>

<p>(f) The CO will accept an offeror's representation in a specific bid or proposal that it is an IEE unless another interested party challenges the IEE representation or the CO has reason to question the representation.

<p>(c) The CO may ask the appropriate Regional Solicitor to review the enterprise's representation.</p>

<p>(d) The IEE representation does not relieve the CO of the obligation for determining contractor responsibility, as required by <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR09.doc#s91. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/09.htm#P7_489"><u>FAR Subpart 9.1</u></a></font>.</p>

<p><a name="P216_30955"></a><b>1480.901   General.</b></p>

<p>(a) The CO can accept an offeror's written representation of being an IEE (as defined in <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .\l. --><a href="http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/other/diar/l."><u>1480.201</u></a></font><a name="P217_31071"></a>) only when it is submitted with an offer in response to a solicitation under the Buy Indian Act. Another interested party may challenge the representation of an offeror or contractor by filing a written challenge to the applicable CO in accordance with the procedures in 1480.902.</p>

<p>(b) After receipt of offers, the CO may question the representation of any offeror in a specific offer by filing a formal objection with the CCO.</p>

<p><a name="P219_31497"></a><b>1480.902   Receipt of challenge.</b></p>

<p>(a) An interested party must file any challenges against an offeror's representation with the local CO.</p>

<p>(b) The challenge must be in writing and must contain the basis for the challenge with accurate, complete, specific, and detailed evidence. The evidence must support the allegation that the offeror is either ineligible or fails to meet both the definitions of “Indian” and of “Indian economic enterprise” established in 1480.201. The CO will dismiss any challenge that is deemed frivolous or that does not meet the conditions in this section.</p>

<p>(c) To be considered timely, a challenge must be received by the CO no later than 10 days after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.</p>

<p>(1) A challenge may be made orally if it is confirmed in writing within the 10-day period after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.</p>

<p>(2) A challenge may be made in writing if it is delivered by hand, telefax, telegram, or letter postmarked within the 10-day period after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.</p>

<p>(3) A CO's objection is always considered timely, whether filed before or after award.</p>

<p>(d) Upon receiving a timely challenge, the CO must:</p>

<p>(1) Notify the challenger of the date it was received, and that the representation of the enterprise being challenged is under consideration by IA; and</p>

<p>(2) Furnish to the economic enterprise (whose representation is being challenged) a request to provide detailed information on its eligibility by certified mail, return receipt requested.</p>

<p>(e) Within 3 days after receiving a copy of the challenge and IA's request for detailed information, the challenged offeror must file with the CO a complete statement answering the allegations in the challenge, and furnish evidence to support its position on representation. If the offeror does not submit the required material within the 3 days, or another period of time granted by the CO, IA may assume that the offeror does not intend to dispute the challenge and IA must not award to the challenged offeror.</p>

<p>(f) Within 10 days after receiving a challenge, the challenged offeror's response and other pertinent information, the CO must determine the representation status of the challenged offeror and notify the challenger and the challenged offeror of the decision by certified mail, return receipt requested, and make known the option to appeal the determination to the Office of Acquisition and Property Management, Department of the Interior (PAM).</p>

<p>(g) If the representation accompanying an offer is challenged and subsequently upheld by the PAM, the written notification of this action must state the reason(s). The PAM may review the economic enterprise for possible suspension or debarment recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="P232_34343"></a><b>1480.903   Award in the face of challenge.</b></p>

<p>(a) Award of a contract in the face of challenge may be made on the basis of the CO's written determination that the challenged offeror's representation is valid.</p>

<p>(1) This determination is final for IA unless it is appealed to the PAM, and the CO is notified of the appeal before award.</p>

<p>(2) If an award was made before the time the CO received notice of appeal, the contract must be presumed to be valid.</p>

<p>(b) After receiving a challenge involving an offeror being considered for award, the CO must not award the contract until the CO has determined the validity of the representation, or 10 days have expired since the CO received the challenge, whichever occurs first. Award must be made when the CO determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest, or the supplies and services are urgently required, or a prompt award will otherwise be advantageous to the Government.</p>

<p>(c) If a timely challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received before award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO must notify eligible offerors within one day that the award will be withheld and a time extension for acceptance is requested.</p>

<p>(d) If a challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received after award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO need not suspend contract performance or terminate the awarded contract unless the CO believes that an award may be invalidated and a delay would prejudice the Government's interest. However, if contract performance is to be suspended, a mutual no cost agreement will be sought.</p>

<p><a name="P239_35975"></a><b>1480.904   Challenge not timely.</b></p>

<p>If a CO receives an untimely filed challenge of a representation, the CO must notify the challenger that the challenge cannot be considered on the instant acquisition but will be considered in any future actions. However, the CO may question at any time, before or after award, the representation of an IEE.</p>
