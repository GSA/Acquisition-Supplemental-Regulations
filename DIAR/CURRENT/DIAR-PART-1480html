         <p class="p List1">(b) The submission of a Solicitation Mailing List Application by an enterprise does not remove the requirement for it to provide representation as an IEE, as required by this part, if it wishes to be considered as an offeror for a specific solicitation. COs may determine the validity of the contents of the applicant's representation.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Any false or misleading information submitted by an enterprise when submitting an offer in consideration for an award set aside under the Buy Indian Act is a violation of the law punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) An interested party must file any challenges against an offeror's representation with the local CO.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The challenge must be in writing and must contain the basis for the challenge with accurate, complete, specific, and detailed evidence. The evidence must support the allegation that the offeror is either ineligible or fails to meet both the definitions of “Indian” and of “Indian economic enterprise” established in 1480.201. The CO will dismiss any challenge that is deemed frivolous or that does not meet the conditions in this section.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) To be considered timely, a challenge must be received by the CO no later than 10 days after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) A challenge may be made orally if it is confirmed in writing within the 10-day period after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) A challenge may be made in writing if it is delivered by hand, telefax, telegram, or letter postmarked within the 10-day period after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) A CO's objection is always considered timely, whether filed before or after award.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Upon receiving a timely challenge, the CO must:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Notify the challenger of the date it was received, and that the representation of the enterprise being challenged is under consideration by IA; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Furnish to the economic enterprise (whose representation is being challenged) a request to provide detailed information on its eligibility by certified mail, return receipt requested.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Within 3 days after receiving a copy of the challenge and IA's request for detailed information, the challenged offeror must file with the CO a complete statement answering the allegations in the challenge, and furnish evidence to support its position on representation. If the offeror does not submit the required material within the 3 days, or another period of time granted by the CO, IA may assume that the offeror does not intend to dispute the challenge and IA must not award to the challenged offeror.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Within 10 days after receiving a challenge, the challenged offeror's response and other pertinent information, the CO must determine the representation status of the challenged offeror and notify the challenger and the challenged offeror of the decision by certified mail, return receipt requested, and make known the option to appeal the determination to the Office of Acquisition and Property Management, Department of the Interior (PAM).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) If the representation accompanying an offer is challenged and subsequently upheld by the PAM, the written notification of this action must state the reason(s). The PAM may review the economic enterprise for possible suspension or debarment recommendations.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Award of a contract in the face of challenge may be made on the basis of the CO's written determination that the challenged offeror's representation is valid.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) This determination is final for IA unless it is appealed to the PAM, and the CO is notified of the appeal before award.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If an award was made before the time the CO received notice of appeal, the contract must be presumed to be valid.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) After receiving a challenge involving an offeror being considered for award, the CO must not award the contract until the CO has determined the validity of the representation, or 10 days have expired since the CO received the challenge, whichever occurs first. Award must be made when the CO determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest, or the supplies and services are urgently required, or a prompt award will otherwise be advantageous to the Government.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) If a timely challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received before award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO must notify eligible offerors within one day that the award will be withheld and a time extension for acceptance is requested.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) If a challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received after award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO need not suspend contract performance or terminate the awarded contract unless the CO believes that an award may be invalidated and a delay would prejudice the Government's interest. However, if contract performance is to be suspended, a mutual no cost agreement will be sought.
