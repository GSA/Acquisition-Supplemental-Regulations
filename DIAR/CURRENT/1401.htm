<p>The Office of the Solicitor (SOL) will review for legal sufficiency selected types and portions of contract actions from Bureaus and offices as required by the FAR, DIAR, and Department-wide policy.

Matters related to legal sufficiency reviews that cannot be resolved between the respective CO and SOL Attorney-Advisor must be submitted for resolution to the HCA and the Assistant Solicitor for Acquisitions and Intellectual Property, Washington, DC.</p>

<p> (a) Administrative review and approval requirements for contract actions shall be established by the HCA and issued as internal bureau procedures. At a minimum, the review and approval requirements must address a representative percentage of the overall contract actions within a bureau/office. The procedures shall include:</p>

<p>(1) Identifying the type and dollar amounts of the actions to be reviewed based on the volume and nature of the contracting office workload;</p>

<p>(2) Designating the stage(s) in the acquisition process when the review(s) shall be performed;</p>

<p>(5) Providing for periodic review of procedures and revision as required, to assure necessary controls are maintained.</p>

<p><a name="P123_15932"></a><b>1401.7001-4   Acquisition performance measurement systems.</b></p>

<p> (a) The acquisition performance measurement system is a three-pronged approach that includes self assessment, statistical data for validation and flexible quality reviews and assessment techniques. This system is required to:</p>

<p>(1) Evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of bureau and office acquisition systems;</p>

<p>(2) Assess the adequacy of policies, procedures and regulations governing the acquisition process; and</p>

<p>(3) Identify and implement changes necessary to improve the systems.</p>

<p>(b) HCA's are responsible for ensuring contracting activity compliance with law and regulations through the review and oversight process.</p>

<p><a name="P129_16610"></a><b>1401.7001-5   Acquisition Management Reviews.</b></p>
