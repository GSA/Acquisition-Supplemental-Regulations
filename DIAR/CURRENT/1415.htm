<p><a name="P19_1446"></a><b>1415.207-70   Department of the Interior proposal and information handling procedures.</b></p>

<p>(a) <i>General. </i>This section establishes procedures that must be used in addition to those prescribed in FAR <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far15.doc#b15207. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/15.htm#P172_27404"><u>15.207</u></a></font>, for the use and disclosure of trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information contained in solicited proposals.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Marking of solicited proposals. </i>A solicited proposal may contain trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information which the offeror, or its subcontractors, prefers not to be disclosed to the public or used by the Government for any purpose other than evaluation of the proposal. To notify the Government of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information contained in a proposal, offerors must mark the cover page of the proposal and each affected page of the proposal with the legends specified in the solicitation provision at <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .1452.docx#b145221571. --><a href="1452.htm#P45_6498"><u>1452.215–71</u></a></font>, Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information—Department of the Interior. COs and other government personnel evaluating a proposal shall not refuse to consider the proposal because it contains information identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Failure to mark. </i>The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a proposal if not marked in accordance with <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .1452.docx#b145221571. --><a href="1452.htm#P45_6498"><u>1452.215–71</u></a></font>. If a request under the Freedom of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in accordance with <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .1452.docx#b145221571. --><a href="1452.htm#P45_6498"><u>1452.215–71</u></a></font>, the offeror concerned shall be notified promptly of the request and given an opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Solicitation provision. </i>The provision at <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .1452.docx#b145221571. --><a href="1452.htm#P45_6498"><u>1452.215–71</u></a></font>, Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information—Department of the Interior, shall be inserted in all requests for proposals and requests for quotations.</p>

<p><a name="P24_3831"></a><b>1415.207-71   Confidentiality of proposal evaluation.</b></p>

<p> (a) The safeguarding of evaluation data and information, including proposals, is essential in order to preserve the integrity of the proposal evaluation process. During the selection process, no member or advisor of any committee appointed to evaluate proposals shall discuss or disclose any information on the number, identity or content of proposals received to any other party (including supervisors) without the written approval of the CO. 18 U.S.C. 1905 prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of business, confidential or trade secret information unless authorized by law.</p>

<p>(b) At the initial meeting of the committee, the CO shall brief all members and advisors on the sensitivity of the evaluation process and the prohibition against unauthorized disclosure of information. At this meeting each member and advisor shall sign a Confidentiality Certificate. During the proposal evaluation process, all proposals, evaluation notes, scoring sheets, and other materials shall be locked in file cabinets or drawers when not in use by committee members and advisors.</p>

<p>(c) The CO shall be the single point of contact regarding communications received from outside parties relating to the acquisition and the evaluation and selection process. Any committee member or advisor who receives a communication from any outside party shall, without discussion, immediately refer the party to the CO. The CO will then determine what further action shall be taken, if any, in responding to the communication. Requests for information made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act shall be referred to the CO for reply. Proposal evaluation committee members and advisors shall not contact any offeror whose proposal is under evaluation. All communications with offerors shall be handled by the CO.</p>

<p>(d) Bureaus and offices may only release proposals outside the Government for evaluation or advice in accordance with the following requirements:</p>

<p>(1) Decisions to release proposals outside the Government for evaluation or advice shall be approved in writing by the HCA;</p>

<p>(2) Outside evaluators and advisors shall sign a Conflict of Interest Certificate and a Confidentiality Certificate in a format approved by the HCA;</p>

<p>(3) Any authorized restrictive legends placed on the proposal by the prospective contractor or subcontractor, or by the Government shall be applied to any reproduction or abstracted information made by the outside evaluator or advisor;</p>

<p>(4) Upon completing the evaluation, all copies of the proposal, as well as any abstracts thereof, shall be returned to the Government office which initially furnished them for evaluation; and</p>

<p>(5) All determinations to release the proposal outside the Government shall take into consideration requirements for avoiding individual conflicts of interest (see <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .1403.docx#b1403101. --><a href="1403.htm#P25_1686"><u>1403.101</u></a></font>) and organizational conflicts of interest (see <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .1409.docx#b14095. --><a href="1409.htm#P70_12725"><u>1409.5</u></a></font> and FAR Subpart 9.5), and the competitive relationship, if any, between the prospective contractor or subcontractor and the prospective outside evaluator.</p>

<p>(e) If outside individuals will be voting members of the evaluation committee or otherwise participate in other than an advisory capacity, then the committee must be constituted as a Federal Advisory Committee in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (PL 92–463) and 308 DM 2. Since the Secretary must appoint such committees in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, there should be very few occasions when use of outside individuals as voting members is justified.</p>

<p>(f) Outside evaluators will usually serve as advisors to the proposal evaluation committee and as such, are consultants. Consultants may be appointed as special employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3109 or contracted for in accordance with <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .1437.docx#b14371. --><a href="1437.htm#P12_621"><u>1437.1</u></a></font>.</p>

<p>(g) Additional restrictions on the disclosure of acquisition evaluation information are listed in FAR Subpart <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far05.doc#s54. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/05.htm#P222_36289"><u>5.4</u></a></font>.</p>

<p><a name="P41_8135"></a><b>1415.303   Responsibilities.</b></p>

<p>(a) The HCA shall determine when a formal source selection process will be used and shall establish implementing procedures.</p>

<p>(b) The formal source selection procedures shall include designating the CO as the individual responsible for the proper control and appropriate release of proprietary and source selection information after source selection.</p>

<p><a name="P44_8511"></a><b>1415.305   Proposal evaluation.</b></p>

<p>The CCO is authorized to make the determination to reject all proposals.</p>

<p><a name="P48_8676"></a><b>1415.404-2   Information to support proposal analysis.</b></p>

<p>The CO shall initiate an audit by sending a completed form DI–1902, Request for Audit, to the Assistant Inspector General for Auditing, OIG (see <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .1452.docx#b145221570. --><a href="1452.htm#P40_5941"><u>1453.215–70</u></a></font>).</p>

<p>(a) The CO shall allow at least 30 working days in assigning a realistic deadline for receipt of the audit report. In exceptional circumstances 20 working days may be allowed but the circumstances shall be documented in the contract file.</p>

<p>(b) Upon receipt of a DI–1902, the OIG will conduct the audit or arrange for its conduct by the cognizant audit agency in accordance with 360 DM 3.7.</p>

<p>(c) Upon receipt of the audit report, the CO and the price analyst (if assigned), shall discuss any questions regarding the report's contents with the cognizant auditor. If a question cannot be resolved or agreement cannot be reached on a recommendation in the report, the CO shall prepare a written statement for the contract file documenting the decision on the matter. A copy of the statement shall be promptly forwarded to the Assistant Inspector General for Auditing for information.</p>

<p><a name="P53_9769"></a><b>1415.404-4   Profit.</b></p>

<p>(a) DOI's policy is to use a structured approach for determining the profit or fee prenegotiation objective in acquisition actions that require cost analysis based on the profit analysis factors in FAR <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far15.doc#b155054. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/15.htm#TopOfPage"><u>15.404-4</u></a></font>, as implemented and supplemented in this section.</p>

<p>(b) In addition to the factors listed in FAR <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far15.doc#b155054. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/15.htm#TopOfPage"><u>15.404–4</u></a></font>(d), one additional factor, “Other Costs,” will be used in evaluating and determining a weighted profit or fee. For further guidance also refer to the Armed Services Pricing Manual (ASPM No. 1). The “Other Costs” factor shall include the contribution of all other direct costs including travel, direct support and hiring of consultants for contract performance.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Applicability. </i>(1) The CO shall prepare a PNM documenting the negotiation of the initial contract award and any subsequent modifications affecting price, cost or fee, including revisions to the prices of contracts awarded through sealed bidding procedures. A PNM is not required for unilateral modifications such as exercising fixed price options or issuing change orders. The memorandum is required for concluding changes and settlements of claims and for issuing orders under Blanket Ordering Agreements, task orders and delivery orders that involve the negotiation of prices, estimated quantities or amounts.</p>

<p>(2) For simplified acquisitions conducted pursuant to FAR Part <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far13.doc. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/13.htm#TopOfPage"><u>13</u></a></font>, the documentation requirements of 1413.106 and FAR <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far13.doc#b13106. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/13.htm#P129_17809"><u>13.106</u></a></font> shall be followed.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Procedures. </i>When the CO prepares the memorandum prescribed in FAR <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far15.doc#b154063. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/15.htm#P623_125386"><u>15.406–3</u></a></font>, the following additional information shall be included to the extent it applies to the contract action.
