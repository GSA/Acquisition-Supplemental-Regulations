<p><b>Source:</b>   75 FR 19829, Apr. 15, 2010, unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p>(a) Policy. DOI regulations governing the conduct and responsibilities of regular and special employees are contained in 43 CFR part 20. Additional guidance is contained in the DOI publication “Ethics Guide for Department of the Interior Employees.” Copies of the Guide can be obtained from the Bureau/Office Ethics Office or on the Internet at <i>http://www.doi.gov/ethics/ </i>. With regard to the provisions of 43 CFR part 20, officials who participate personally and substantially in DOI procurements (as defined in FAR <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far03.doc#b31043. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/03.htm#P92_14637"><u>3.104–3</u></a></font>), may not solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan or anything of monetary value from a competing contractor during the conduct of a procurement.</p>

<p>(b)(1) Officials may not accept or solicit from any competing contractor any services that involve the development of specifications, statements of work, evaluation criteria, or formal cost estimates to be used in a procurement unless such services are formally contracted for pursuant to the FAR and DIAR, and until the organizational COI provisions in FAR Subpart 9.5 have been fully addressed. This does not preclude COs from issuing formal Requests for Comment (RFC) or draft RFPs.</p>

<p>(2) IT resources shall not be accepted, installed or utilized by the Department on a no cost, free of charge basis (this includes donated equipment but not public domain software), except as permitted by law.</p>

<p><a name="P30_3143"></a><b>1403.101-70   Technical evaluators and advisors.</b></p>

<p>(a) Technical evaluators and advisors, including members of proposal evaluation committees, must render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance and advice.</p>

<p>(b) With the exception of contracting personnel, proposal evaluators and advisors are not required to file a Confidential Financial Disclosure Report (SF450) unless they occupy positions identified in 43 CFR 20.735.30(b). Therefore, when an individual is appointed as an evaluator or advisor, he/she must sign and return to the CO a Conflict of Interest Certificate in a format approved by the HCA. If a potential COI exists, the appointee must not be allowed to evaluate or advise on an offeror's proposal until the conflict has been resolved with the servicing Ethics Counselor.</p>

<p>(c) During the evaluation process, each evaluator and advisor is responsible for ensuring that there are no financial or employment interests that conflict or give the appearance of conflicting with his or her duty to evaluate proposals impartially and objectively. Examples of situations that may be prohibited or represent a potential COI include:</p>

<p>(1) Financial interest, including stocks and bonds, in a firm that submits, or is expected to submit, an offer in response to the solicitation;</p>

<p>(2) Outstanding financial commitments to any actual or potential offeror;</p>

<p>(3) Employment in any capacity, even if otherwise permissible, by any actual or potential offeror;</p>

<p>(4) Employment within the last 12 months by an actual or potential offeror;</p>

<p>(5) Any non-vested pension or re-employment rights, or interest in profit sharing or stock bonus plans arising out of past employment by an actual or potential offeror; or</p>

<p>(6) Employment of any member of the immediate family by an actual or potential offeror.</p>

<p>(d) Bureaus shall include a notice similar to the following in all correspondence notifying employees of appointments to serve as technical evaluators or advisors, formally called Technical Evaluation Panels (TEP) and/or Source Evaluation Boards (SEB):</p>

<p>You shall not solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or anything of monetary value from a competing contractor involved in any action for which you participate personally and substantially under this delegation of authority. You are also reminded of other conduct prohibitions in FAR <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far03.doc#b31043. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/03.htm#P92_14637"><u>3.104–3</u></a></font>, including negotiating with competing contractors for future employment, disclosure of contractor bid or proposal information or source selection information, and post-Government employment restrictions.</p>

<p>Such notice shall include an acknowledgement of receipt signed and returned by the employee.</p>

<p><a name="P66_8145"></a><b>1403.104-7   Violations or possible violations.</b></p>

<p>(a)(1) The CO's determination that there is no impact on the procurement due to a possible violation of the Procurement Integrity Act and decision to proceed with contract award shall receive concurrence from an individual one level above the CO.</p>

<p>(2) In case of nonconcurrence with the CO's determination, the HCA shall provide a copy of the reported violation and recommended action to the OIG in accordance with Part 111 DM 3. The CO, in consultation with the SOL and the OIG, must justify the compelling circumstances for immediate award and obtain approval to proceed from the BPC without the power of redelegation. Copies of the determination to proceed with the award will be sent to the Director, PAM, for submission to the AS/PMB.</p>

The date(s), location(s) and name(s) of all parties involved in the incident shall be included in the report.</p>

<p><a name="P72_9665"></a><b>1403.204   Treatment of violations.</b></p>

<p>(a) The CO will provide the contractor with a formal notice that summarizes the events involving the suspected violation and affords the contractor the opportunity to take the action(s) listed under FAR <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far03.doc#b3204. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/03.htm#P214_36063"><u>3.204</u></a></font>(b). The notice shall contain a time limit for reply and shall be sent by certified mail return receipt requested. The CO will submit the report, additional documentary evidence and other pertinent information to the HCA for disposition with a recommended course of action. A copy of this submission must also be sent to the Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations. In consultation with the SOL and the OIG, and based on the results of any further discussion with the contractor, its counsel or witnesses, the HCA may make a recommendation to the Director, PAM, pursuant to FAR <font color="#0000ff"><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far03.doc#b3204. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/03.htm#P214_36063"><u>3.204</u></a></font>(c) and shall provide formal notice to the contractor of such recommendation.</p>

<p>Award of a contract does not signify endorsement of the supplies or services purchased, nor does it signify agreement with any views espoused by officials of the awardee. It is vital to the integrity of the procurement system to avoid even the appearance of an improper preference toward a particular vendor. Therefore, contractors shall not be permitted to publicize, or otherwise circulate, promotional materials that state or imply Governmental endorsement of a product, service or position which the contractor represents.</p>

<p><a name="P88_12511"></a><b>1403.570-2   Procedures.</b></p>

<p>If a contractor requests a determination as to the propriety of such promotional material, the response shall be coordinated with the cognizant Public Affairs Office and Ethics Officer.</p>
