      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) IA must use the negotiation authority of the Buy Indian Act to give preference to Indians or Federally Recognized Tribes whenever the use of that authority is practicable. The Buy Indian Act provides that so far as may be practicable, Indian labor shall be employed, and purchases of the products (including, but not limited to printing, notwithstanding any other law) of Indian industry may be made in open market at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior. Thus, IA may use the Buy Indian Act to give preference to IEEs through set-asides when acquiring supplies, general services, A&amp;E services, or construction to meet IA needs and requirements. All other FAR and DIAR requirements that do not conflict with this part, such as requirements applicable to the acquisition of A&amp;E and construction services, remain applicable.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The Buy Indian Act does not apply when a supply requirement can be met by existing inventories of the requiring agency or excess from other agencies.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The CO will give priority to ISBEEs for all purchases, regardless of dollar value. COs when prioritizing ISBEEs may consider either:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) A set-aside for ISBEEs; or
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) A sole source award to an ISBEE, as authorized under the FAR.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) If the CO determines after market research that there is no reasonable expectation of obtaining offers that will be competitive in terms of market price, quality, and delivery, the CO may consider either:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) A set-aside for IEEs; or
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) A sole source award to an IEE, as authorized under the FAR.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) If the CO determines after market research that there is no reasonable expectation of obtaining offers that will be competitive in terms of market price, quality, and delivery from ISBEEs or IEEs, then the CO must follow the Deviation process under 1480.403.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) When only one offer is received from a responsible IEE in response to an acquisition set-aside or direct negotiation under paragraph (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) If the offer is not at a reasonable and fair market price, then the CO may negotiate with that enterprise for a reasonable and fair market price.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If the offer is at a reasonable and fair market price, then the CO must:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Make an award to that enterprise;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Document the reason only one offer was considered; and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Initiate action to increase competition in future solicitations.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) If the offers received from one or more responsible IEEs in response to an acquisition set-aside under paragraph (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section are not reasonable or otherwise unacceptable, then the CO must follow the deviation process under 1480.403. The CO must document in the deviation determination the reasons why the IEE offeror(s) were not reasonable or otherwise unacceptable.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) If a deviation determination is approved, the CO must cancel the set-aside solicitation and inform all offerors in writing.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) When the solicitation of the same requirement is posted, the CO must inform all previous offerors in writing of the solicitation number.

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The challenge must be in writing and must contain the basis for the challenge with accurate, complete, specific, and detailed evidence. The evidence must support the allegation that the offeror fails to meet the definition of “Indian Economic Enterprise” or “Indian Small Business Economic Enterprise” as defined in 1480.201 or is otherwise ineligible. The CO will dismiss any challenge that is deemed frivolous or that does not meet the conditions in this section.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) To be considered timely, a challenge must be received by the CO no later than 10 days after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.

         <p class="p List2">(3) A CO's challenge to a certification is always considered timely, whether filed before or after award.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Upon receiving a timely challenge, the CO must:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Notify the challenger of the date it was received, and that the representation of the enterprise being challenged is under consideration; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Furnish to the offeror (whose representation is being challenged) a request to provide detailed information on its eligibility by certified mail, return receipt requested or electronic mail.

If the offeror does not submit the required material within the 3 days, or another period of time granted by the CO, the CO may assume that the offeror does not intend to dispute the challenge and must not award to the challenged offeror.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Within 10 days after receiving a challenge, the challenged offeror's response, and any other pertinent information, the CO must determine the representation status of the challenged offeror and notify the challenger and the challenged offeror of the decision by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by other expeditious means including by hand, email, telefax, or telegraph if actual delivery can be shown, and make known to all parties the option to appeal the determination to the Director, Office of Acquisition and Property Management, Department of the Interior (PAM).

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Award of a contract in the face of challenge may be made on the basis of the CO's written determination that the challenged offeror's representation is valid.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) This determination of validity is final unless it is appealed to the Director of PAM and the CO is notified of the appeal before making award.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If an award was made before the CO received notice of appeal, the award is presumed to be valid.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) After receiving a challenge involving an offeror being considered for award, the CO must not award the contract until the CO has determined the validity of the representation. Award may be made in the face of a timely challenge when the CO determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest, is urgently required, or a prompt award will otherwise be advantageous to the Government.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) If a timely challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received before award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO must notify eligible offerors within one day that the solicitation will not be awarded due to a pending challenge. The CO also may ask eligible offerors to extend the period for acceptance of their proposals.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) If a challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received after award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO need not suspend contract performance or terminate the awarded contract unless the CO believes that an award may be invalidated and a delay would prejudice the Government's interest. However, if contract performance is to be suspended or terminated, a mutual no cost agreement will be sought.
