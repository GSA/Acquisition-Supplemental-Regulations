      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Purpose.</em> The Mentor-Protégé Program is designed to motivate and encourage firms to assist small businesses with business development, including small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The program is also designed to improve the performance of DOS contracts and subcontracts, foster the establishment of long-term business relationships between small businesses and prime contractors, and increase the overall number of small businesses that receive DOS contract and subcontract awards. The program is limited to non-commercial item acquisitions.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Definitions.</em> The definitions of small business (SB), HUBZone small business concern (HUBZone), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) are the same as found in FAR 2.101.

</p>

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Non-affiliation.</em> For purposes of the Small Business Act, a protégé firm is not considered an affiliate of a mentor firm solely because the protégé firm is receiving developmental assistance from the mentor firm under the program.
</p>

				</p>
<p class="p List2">(1)

				</p>

			Under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(E)), DOS is authorized to provide appropriate incentives to encourage subcontracting opportunities for small businesses consistent with the efficient and economical performance of the contract. This authority is limited to negotiated acquisitions.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Before awarding a contract that requires a subcontracting plan, the existence of a mentor-protégé arrangement, and performance, if any, under an existing arrangement, may be considered by the contracting officer in:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Evaluating the quality of a proposed subcontracting plan under FAR 19.704-5; and,
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Assessing the prime contractor's compliance with the subcontracting plans submitted in previous contracts as a factor in determining contractor responsibility under FAR 19.705-5(a)(1).

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Measurement of program success.</em> The success of the DOS Mentor-Protégé Program will be measured by:
