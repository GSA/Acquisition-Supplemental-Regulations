</p>
                                    <p xtrc="HD1">Section 8(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as Amended (AUG 1999)
</p>
                                    <p outputclass="List1">(a) Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The Boycott of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities under the Export Administration Act:
</p>
                                    <p outputclass="List2">(1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli business concern, or with any national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country;

                                    <p outputclass="List2">(2) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to employ or otherwise discriminating against any person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such person;

                                    <p outputclass="List2">(3) Furnishing information with respect to the race, religion, or national origin of any U.S. person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such U.S. person;
</p>
                                    <p outputclass="List2">(4) Furnishing information about whether any person has, has had, or proposes to have any business relationship (including a relationship by way of sale, purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping or other transport, insurance, investment, or supply) with or in the State of Israel, with any business concern organized under the laws of the State of Israel, with any Israeli national or resident, or with any person which is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in Israel;
