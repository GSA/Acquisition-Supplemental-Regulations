Where the DOSAR implements a specific part, subpart, section, or subsection of the FAR, the DOSAR coverage is numbered and titled to correspond to the appropriate FAR number and title, except that the DOSAR number will include a 6 or 60 such that there will always be three numbers to the left of the decimal. For example, the DOSAR implementation of FAR 14.1 is shown as 614.1 and the DOSAR implementation of FAR 1.301 is shown as 601.301. Materials that supplement the FAR are assigned the numbers 70 and up. For example, DOSAR requires additional definitions than those used in FAR; this supplementary material is provided in 602.101-70.

         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Delegations.</em> As stated in 601.603-3(a), there is no contracting officer authority conferred by virtue of position. Pursuant to 601.602-1(b), the Procurement Executive has designated the following as contracting activities as defined in FAR 2.101. These authorities are not redelegable. In addition, specific individuals are designated as heads of contracting activities (HCAs) (<em class="ph i">see</em> FAR 2.101): 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Overseas posts.</em> Each overseas post shall be regarded as a contracting activity to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies, equipment, publications, and services. The Principal Officer, the Management Officer, or the Supervisory General Services Officer are designated as HCAs; <em class="ph i">provided,</em> that he/she has a contracting officer's warrant issued by the Procurement Executive. The Procurement Executive (or authorized A/OPE staff) may delegate to a contracting officer, on a case-by-case basis, the authority to award a contract or modification which exceeds the contracting officer's warrant level. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) No authority is delegated to enter into cost-reimbursement, fixed-price incentive, or fixed-price redeterminable contracts. Design/build solicitations and contracts may only be entered into with the written approval of A/OPE and OBO. Proposed construction contracts exceeding $500,000 and any related architect-engineer contracts must have prior A/OPE approval. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) When expressly authorized by a U.S. Government agency which does not have a contracting officer at the post, the officers named in paragraph (a)(1) introductory text of this section may enter into contracts for that agency. Use of this authority is subject to the statutory authority of that agency and any special contract terms or other requirements necessary for compliance with any conditions or limitations applicable to the funds of that agency. The agency's authorization shall cite the statute(s) and state any special contract terms or other requirements with which the acquisition so authorized must comply. In view of the contracting officer's responsibility for the legal, technical, and administrative sufficiency of contracts, questions regarding the propriety of contracting actions that the post is required to take pursuant to this authority may be referred to the Department for resolution with the headquarters of the agency concerned. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Office of Logistics Management; Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM).</em> The authority to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies and services, including construction, is delegated to the Director or designee as the HCA. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Foreign Service Institute.</em> The authority to enter into and administer contracts pursuant to Chapter 7, Title I, of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4021 <em class="ph i">et seq.</em>), is delegated to the Director of the Foreign Service Institute, the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive Director, and the Supervisory Contracting Officer as the HCA. 
</p>

         <p class="p List2">(5) <em class="ph i">U.S. Mission to the United Nations.</em> The authority to enter into and administer contracts pursuant to the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C.287), is delegated to the Counselor for Administration as the HCA.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Other delegations.</em> Several DOS offices have been delegated limited procurement authority, although they have not been designated as HCAs. Matters requiring HCA resolution are referred to the A/LM/AQM. These delegations are provided only to warranted contracting officers in the respective offices. They are as follows:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Office of Language Services.</em> The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation for interpreting, translating, conference reporting, and related language support and escort services.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Office of International Conferences.</em> The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation pursuant to section 5, Title I, of the Department of State Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) <em class="ph i">Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.</em> The authority to enter into and administer 8(a) purchase orders and contracts as a third party pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Small Business Administration.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) When the person who made the unauthorized contractual commitment is no longer available to attest to the circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, an officer from the responsible office shall accomplish the requirements of this paragraph; the statement shall identify the individual responsible for the unauthorized commitment.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) In addition, a cognizant management official from the office that employed the individual who made the unauthorized commitment at the time the unauthorized commitment was made shall provide a statement detailing actions that he/she will take to ensure that such commitments will not occur again under the same or similar circumstances.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) This statement shall be cleared by the Executive Director of the Bureau that employs (or employed) the person who made the unauthorized commitment.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The contracting officer assigned the ratification action shall prepare and execute a recommendation to the ratifying official. The contracting officer shall either recommend that the ratifying official approve and ratify the unauthorized commitment; or, disapprove the ratification of the unauthorized commitment.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The recommendation shall include the facts and circumstances of the unauthorized commitment; the information prescribed in FAR 1.602-3(c)(1) and (c)(3) through (6); and a recommendation to the ratifying official as to whether the unauthorized commitment should be ratified.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Following the signature of the contracting officer, the recommendation shall include a statement that the ratifying official could have granted authority to enter into a contractual commitment at the time it was made and still has the authority to do so; that the ratifying official hereby ratifies (or disapproves) the unauthorized commitment in the amount specified; and a date and signature block for the ratifying official.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The information required in paragraph (b)
				</p><p class="p List2">(1) 
			of this section shall be supported by factual findings included or referenced in the recommendation.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) The contracting officer shall submit the complete file to the ratifying official. For actions exceeding $1,000, the file shall be submitted through the head of the contracting activity to the Procurement Executive.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Upon receipt and review of the complete file, if the ratifying official ratifies the unauthorized commitment, the file shall be returned, through the head of the contracting activity if the action exceeds $1,000, to the contracting officer for issuance of the appropriate contractual document(s). If the request for ratification is not justified, the ratifying official shall return the request to the head of the contracting activity (if over $1,000) or to the contracting officer (if under $1,000) with a written explanation for the decision and a recommendation for disposition of the action.
