      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) It is the Department's policy that all contracts, regardless of dollar value, be properly documented so as to provide a complete record of: pre-solicitation activities; the solicitation, evaluation, and award process; and, the administration of the contract through closeout.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) All domestic contracting activities awarding contracts using other than simplified acquisition procedures shall use the format of Form DS-1930, <i>Domestic Contract File Table of Contents,</i> and all overseas contracting activities shall use the format of Form DS-1929, <i>Overseas Contract File Table of Contents,</i> unless an alternate format has been approved by A/OPE.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(c) Each table of contents is organized in chronological order, with six separate sections for each of the six parts of the file folder (from Section I, Pre-Solicitation, through Section VI, Contract and Modifications/Contract Closeout). Alternatively, for ease of contract administration, offices may choose to organize contract files with Section VI of the table of contents at the beginning of the folder, with Section I at the back of the folder.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(d) The format of Form DS-1928, <i>Contract Administration File Table of Contents,</i> may be used by those offices that prefer to have a separate file folder for contract modifications or delivery/task orders.
