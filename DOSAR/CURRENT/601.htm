<p align="center"><a name="P3_4"></a><b>PART 601 - DEPARTMENT OF STATE ACQUISITION REGULATION SYSTEM</b></p>

<p><a name="P6_64"></a><b>601.000 Scope of part.</b></p>

<p>  This part describes the Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) in terms of establishment, relationship to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), arrangement, applicability, and deviation procedures.</p>

<p><a name="P11_301"></a><b>Subpart 601.1 - Purpose, Authority, Issuance</b></p>

<p><a name="P13_345"></a><b>601.101  Purpose.</b></p>

<p>  The DOSAR is issued to provide Department guidance in accordance with the policy cited in <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#b1301. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.htm#P893_29218">FAR 1.301</a></u></font>(a)(2).  The portions of this regulation that affect the relationship between a Department of State organization and a contractor or potential contractor have been published in this Chapter 6 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations, in accordance with <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#b1301. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.htm#P893_29218">FAR 1.301</a></u></font>(b).</p>

<p><a name="P19_753"></a><b>601.105-3  Copies.</b></p>

<p>  The DOSAR is available through the Department’s Intranet system at http://aope.a.state.gov, or through the Internet from A/OPE’s Acquisition Website.  The Internet address is:  http://www.statebuy.state.gov/</p>

<p><a name="P23_984"></a><b>601.106  OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.</b></p>

<p>  The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) requires that Federal agencies obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget before collecting information from ten (10) or more members of the public. Individuals are not required to respond to information collection unless the OMB number and burden estimate information is provided. Accordingly, the information and recordkeeping requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by OMB under OMB Control Number 1405-0050. The information and recordkeeping requirements for Form DS-4053, Department of State Mentor-Protégé Program Application, have been approved by OMB under OMB Control Number 1405-0161.</p>

<p><a name="P27_1731"></a><b>Subpart 601.2 - Administration</b></p>

<p><a name="P29_1761"></a><b>601.201  Maintenance of the FAR.</b></p>

<p><a name="P31_1793"></a><b>601.201-1  The two councils.</b></p>

<p>   The Office of the Procurement Executive (A/OPE) represents the Department of State (DOS) on the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council.  The Procurement Executive shall appoint a representative for this purpose.  A/OPE is responsible for coordinating with all interested DOS elements on proposed FAR revisions and for advocating FAR revisions sought by the Department.</p>

<p><a name="P36_2189"></a><b>Subpart 601.3 - Agency Acquisition Regulations</b></p>

<p><a name="P38_2235"></a><b>601.301  Policy.</b></p>

<p>  (a)  The Assistant Secretary of State for Administration is the agency head for the purposes of FAR 1.301. The Assistant Secretary of State for Administration redelegated to the Procurement Executive the authority to prescribe, promulgate, and amend DOS acquisition policies, rules, and regulations.</p>

<p>  (b)  The Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) is prescribed under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2658 and 40 U.S.C. 486(c).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>   (c)  The DOSAR implements and supplements the FAR.  </p>

<p><a name="P46_2743"></a><b>601.302  Limitations.</b></p>

<p>  (a)  The FAR and the DOSAR apply to all DOS acquisitions of personal property and services, including construction, both within and outside the United States, unless expressly excluded by this subpart, or exempt from the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 474(7)), or undertaken pursuant to the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4308) or the Foreign Service Buildings Act of 1926, as amended (22 U.S.C. 292 <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p>  (b)  At posts where Joint Administrative Offices have been formed and DOS is the procurement agency, the FAR and DOSAR apply to all administrative and technical support acquisitions.</p>

<p><a name="P52_3447"></a><b>601.303  Publication and codification.</b></p>

<p>  (a)  The DOSAR is issued as Chapter 6 of Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations.  The DOSAR is established as Chapter 6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations System.  The DOSAR is divided into the same parts, subparts, sections, subsections, and paragraphs as the FAR.  However, when the FAR coverage is adequate by itself, there will be no corresponding DOSAR coverage.  Where the DOSAR <u>implements</u> a specific part, subpart, section, or subsection of the FAR, the DOSAR coverage is numbered and titled to correspond to the appropriate FAR number and title, except that the DOSAR number will include a 6 or 60 such that there will always be three numbers to the left of the decimal.  For example, the DOSAR implementation of FAR 14.1 is shown as 614.1 and the DOSAR implementation of FAR 1.301 is shown as 601.301.  Materials that <u>supplement</u> the FAR are assigned the numbers 70 and up.  For example, DOSAR requires additional definitions than those used in FAR; this supplementary material is provided in 602.101-70.</p>

<p>  (b)  The DOSAR and its revisions are published in the Federal Register and in the Code of Federal Regulations, both of which may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.</p>

<p>   (c)  The DOSAR shall be referenced in the same manner as described at <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#b11052. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.htm#P63_11505">FAR 1.105-2</a></u></font>(c).</p>

<p><a name="P71_5096"></a><b>601.405  Deviations pertaining to treaties and executive agreements.</b></p>

<p><a name="P75_5369"></a><b>601.470  Deviations from the DOSAR.</b></p>

<p>  The authority to approve any deviations from the DOSAR is reserved to the Procurement Executive.</p>

<p>  </p>

<p><a name="P79_5504"></a><b>601.471  Procedures.</b></p>

<p>  (a)  The head of the contracting activity shall submit to the Procurement Executive a written request for each deviation from the FAR or the DOSAR, whether for individual cases, classes of cases, or deviations pertaining to treaties and executive agreements.  Each request for a deviation shall state-</p>

Use of this authority is subject to the statutory authority of that agency and any special contract terms or other requirements necessary for compliance with any conditions or limitations applicable to the funds of that agency.  The agency's authorization shall cite the statute(s) and state any special contract terms or other requirements with which the acquisition so authorized must comply.  In view of the contracting officer's responsibility for the legal, technical, and administrative sufficiency of contracts, questions regarding the propriety of contracting actions that the post is required to take pursuant to this authority may be referred to the Department for resolution with the headquarters of the agency concerned.</p>

<p><a name="P185_16604"></a><b>601.602-1  Authority.</b></p>

<p>  (a)  DOS contracts are awarded pursuant to the foreign affairs management responsibilities conferred on the Secretary of State (22 U.S.C. 2656), and the various laws, regulations, and Executive Orders relating thereto.</p>

<p>  (b)  Except as otherwise provided by law, DOS regulations, and this DOSAR, the Procurement Executive has the authority to execute, award, and administer contracts, purchase orders, other contractual arrangements, and other agreements, including FAR-covered interagency acquisition agreements, for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of personal property, services, and for the sale of personal property.  The Procurement Executive may further delegate this authority to those DOS employees appointed or designated to the contracting activities enumerated in 601.601-70.</p>

<p><a name="P193_17706"></a><b>601.602-3  Ratification of unauthorized commitments.</b> </p>

<p>  (b)  <i>Policy</i>.  (1)  The Government generally is not bound by unauthorized commitments. Unauthorized commitments violate the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, other Federal laws, the FAR, the DOSAR, and proper acquisition practice. Therefore, such unauthorized commitments are serious violations that could result in disciplinary action against the transgressor, e.g., withdrawal of a contracting officer's warrant or a Contracting Officer's Representative delegation or collection action.</p>

<p>  (2)(i)  <i>Unauthorized commitments not exceeding $1,000.</i>  The head of the contracting activity is delegated the authority to serve as the ratifying official for unauthorized commitments not exceeding $1,000, including unauthorized commitments from other agencies where a DOS employee serves as the contracting officer for that action. The head of the contracting activity may refer any actions not exceeding $1,000 to the DOS Procurement Executive for ratification if he or she so chooses.</p>

<p>  (ii)  <i>Unauthorized commitments exceeding $1,000.</i>  All DOS unauthorized commitments in excess of $1,000 shall be submitted to the DOS Procurement Executive for ratification. Unauthorized commitments in excess of $1,000 from other agencies may be referred to the other agency's representative at post for resolution in accordance with that agency's ratification process.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>  (3)  <i>Claims</i>.  Unauthorized contractual commitments that would involve claims subject to resolution under the Contracts Dispute Act of 1978 shall be processed in accordance with <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far33.doc#s332. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/33.htm#P136_29861">FAR subpart 33.2</a></u></font> and subpart 633.2.</p>

<p>  (4)  <i>Disciplinary action</i>.  The Procurement Executive may refer egregious cases of unauthorized commitments to HR/ER for possible disciplinary action in accordance with 3 FAM 4370 or 3 FAM 4540. Examples might include repeated unauthorized commitments knowingly made by an employee; failure to take responsibility for a deliberate unauthorized commitment; or similar reasons. The Procurement Executive may revoke the appointment certificate of any contracting officer who makes an unauthorized commitment. The Procurement Executive may direct a contracting officer to revoke the appointment memorandum of a Contracting Officer's Representative or Government Technical Monitor who makes an unauthorized commitment.</p>

<p><a name="P205_20052"></a><b>601.602-3-70  Procedures.</b></p>

That person shall provide a complete written, signed statement of the facts, including why normal acquisition procedures were not followed; a statement justifying a sole source acquisition (Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition) if the unauthorized commitment exceeds $100,000; why and how the vendor was selected; a list of other sources considered; a description of work or products; a statement regarding the status of performance; an estimated or agreed price; certified funding citations; a statement as to why he/she should not be personally liable for the cost, e.g., a public purpose was served and no personal benefit was received; a statement as to whether the individual has ever been responsible for any other unauthorized commitments in the Department of State; and, a statement as to the number of unauthorized commitments processed by the responsible office within the last three calendar years and the circumstances surrounding each of these actions.</p>

<p>  (2)  When the person who made the unauthorized contractual commitment is no longer available to attest to the circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, an officer from the responsible office shall accomplish the requirements of this paragraph; the statement shall identify the individual responsible for the unauthorized commitment.</p>

<p>  (3)  In addition, a cognizant management official from the office that employed the individual who made the unauthorized commitment at the time the unauthorized commitment was made shall provide a statement detailing actions that he/she will take to ensure that such commitments will not occur again under the same or similar circumstances.</p>

<p>  (4)  This statement shall be cleared by the Executive Director of the Bureau that employs (or employed) the person who made the unauthorized commitment. </p>

<p>  (b)  The contracting officer assigned the ratification action shall prepare and execute a recommendation to the ratifying official. The contracting officer shall either recommend that the ratifying official approve and ratify the unauthorized commitment; or, disapprove the ratification of the unauthorized commitment.</p>

<p>  (1)  The recommendation shall include the facts and circumstances of the unauthorized commitment; the information prescribed in <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/Far01.doc#b16023. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/01.htm#P990_46251">FAR 1.602-3</a></u></font>(c)(1) and (c)(3) through (6); and a recommendation to the ratifying official as to whether the unauthorized commitment should be ratified.</p>

<p>  (2)  Following the signature of the contracting officer, the recommendation shall include a statement that the ratifying official could have granted authority to enter into a contractual commitment at the time it was made and still has the authority to do so; that the ratifying official hereby ratifies (or disapproves) the unauthorized commitment in the amount specified; and a date and signature block for the ratifying official.</p>

<p>  (c) The information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be supported by factual findings included or referenced in the recommendation.</p>

<p>  (d)  The contracting officer shall submit the complete file to the ratifying official. For actions exceeding $1,000, the file shall be submitted through the head of the contracting activity to the Procurement Executive.</p>

<p>  (e)  Upon receipt and review of the complete file, if the ratifying official ratifies the unauthorized commitment, the file shall be returned, through the head of the contracting activity if the action exceeds $1,000, to the contracting officer for issuance of the appropriate contractual document(s). If the request for ratification is not justified, the ratifying official shall return the request to the head of the contracting activity (if over $1,000) or to the contracting officer (if under $1,000) with a written explanation for the decision and a recommendation for disposition of the action.</p>
