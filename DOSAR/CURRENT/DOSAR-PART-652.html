Direct service labor costs include only the costs of wages and direct benefits (such as social security, health insurance, unemployment compensation insurance) paid to or incurred for the direct benefit of personnel performing services under one of the categories listed in Section [identify section number] of this contract. Price adjustments will include only changes in direct service labor costs incurred in order to comply with the requirements of the law.

                                    <p class="p List1">(e) Only direct cost changes mandated by enacted laws shall be considered for adjustment under this contract. Changes for purposes of maintaining parity of pay between employees at the minimum mandated levels and employees already paid at levels above the newly mandated minimums shall not be considered. Therefore, if the contractor elects to increase payments to employees who are already being paid at or above the mandated amounts, such increased costs shall be borne solely by the contractor and shall not be justification for an increase in the hourly and monthly rates under this contract.

Only the changes in direct service labor wages (and any benefits based directly on wages) shall be considered by the U.S. Government as basis for contract price changes.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(h) No request by the contractor for an adjustment under this clause shall be allowed if asserted after final payment has been made under this contract.

A prospective bidder/offeror may be an individual organization or firm, a formal joint venture in which the co-venturers have reduced their arrangement to writing, or a de facto joint venture where no formal agreement has been reached, but the offering entity relies upon the experience of a related U.S. firm that guarantees performance. To be considered a “qualified United States joint venture person,” the joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. person listed in Section 402. By signing this bid/proposal, the U.S. person co-venturer agrees to be individually responsible for performance of the contract, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.</p>

To assist business entities to determine whether they qualify as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person entitled to preference under Section 136, guidance is hereby provided. Only those prospective offerors submitting a properly completed and certified Volume 5 with their initial proposals will be considered in the determination of eligibility for assignment of preference as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person. For ease of reference, statutory language is quoted immediately before the definitions that apply to it. Space for the required information is provided immediately following each definition.

Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of another organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or local, national or offshore organizations, must do so by way of a joint venture. The contract resulting from this solicitation shall not allow subcontracting. A prospective offeror may be a sole proprietorship, a formal joint venture in which the co-venturers have reduced their arrangement to writing, or a de facto joint venture with no written agreement. To be considered a “qualified joint venture person,” the joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. joint venture person listed in Section 136. By signing this proposal, the U.S. person co-venturer agrees to be individually responsible for performance of the contract, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.</p>
