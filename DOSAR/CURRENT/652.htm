<p>PRICE ADJUSTMENT (AUG 1999)</p>

<p>  (a)  The contract price may be increased or decreased in actual costs of direct service labor which result directly from laws enacted and effective during the term of this contract by the [<i>insert name of country</i>] Government.  Direct service labor costs include only the cost of wages and direct benefits (such as social security, health insurance, unemployment compensation insurance) paid to or incurred for the direct benefit of personnel performing services under one of the categories listed in Section [<i>identify section number</i>] of this contract.  Price adjustments will include only changes in direct service labor costs incurred in order to comply with the requirements of the law.  No adjustment will be made under this clause with respect to labor costs of personnel not performing direct service labor under the categories of Section [<i>identify section number</i>], nor for overhead, profit, general and administrative (G&amp;A) costs, taxes or any other costs whatsoever.</p>

<p>  (b)  For the contracting officer to consider any request for adjustment, the contractor shall demonstrate in writing:</p>

<p>  (1)  That the change in the law occurred during the term of this contract and subsequent to the award date of the contract; and,</p>

<p>  (2)  That the change in the law could not have been reasonably anticipated prior to contract award; and,</p>

<p>  (3)  How the change in the law directly affects the contractors costs under this contract.</p>

<p>  (c)  The contractor shall present data that clearly supports any request for adjustment.  This data shall be submitted no later than 30 calendar days after the changes in the law have been made public.  This data shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>

<p>  (1)  The calculation of the amount of adjustment requested; and,</p>

<p>  (2)  Documentation which identifies and provides the appropriate portions of the text of the particular law from which the request is derived.</p>

<p>  (d)  In order to establish the change between the requested adjusted rate and the original rate, the contractor shall support the appropriate data and composition of the original rate and the requested adjusted rate.  This shall include details regarding specific hourly rates paid to individual employees.  For contracts paid in U.S. dollars, the contractor’s request for price adjustment shall present data reflecting:</p>

<p>  (1)  The exchange rate in effect on the date of the contractors proposal that was accepted for the basic contract; and,</p>

<p>  (2)  The current exchange rate and its effect on payment of workers in local currency.</p>

<p>The allowable adjustment shall be limited to the extent to which increases in direct service labor costs due to host country law changes are not offset by exchange rate gains.</p>

<p>  (e)  Only direct cost changes mandated by enacted laws shall be considered for adjustment under this contract.  Changes for purposes of maintaining parity of pay between employees at the minimum mandated levels and employees already paid at levels above the newly mandated minimums shall not be considered.  Therefore, if the contractor elects to increase payments to employees who are already being paid at or above the mandated amounts, such increased costs shall be borne solely by the contractor and shall not be justification for an increase in the hourly and monthly rates under this contract.</p>

<p>  (f)  Any request for adjustment shall be presented by signature of an officer or general partner of the contractor having overall responsibility for the conduct of the contractors affairs.</p>

<p>  (g)  No adjustment shall be made to the contract price that relates to any indirect, overhead, or fixed costs, profit or fee.  Only the changes in direct service labor wages (and any benefits based directly on wages) shall be considered by the U.S. Government as basis for contract price changes.</p>

<p>  (h)  No request by the contractor for an adjustment under this clause shall be allowed if asserted after final payment has been made under this contract.</p>

<p>  (i)  This clause shall only apply to laws enacted by the [<i>insert name of country</i>] Government meeting the criterion set forth above in paragraph (b).  No adjustments shall be made due to currency fluctuations in exchange rates.</p>

<p>SECTION 8(A) OF THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 1979, AS AMENDED  (AUG 1999)</p>

<p>  (a)  Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation.  The Boycott of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities under the Export Administration Act:</p>

<p>  (1)  Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli concern, or with any national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country;</p>

<p>  (6)  Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing business with the State of Israel.</p>

<p>  (b)  Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden “compliance with the boycott”, and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)’s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) above:</p>

<p>  (1)  Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:</p>

<p>  (i)  Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,</p>

<p>  (ii)  Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment;</p>

<p>  (2)  Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;</p>

<p>  (3)  Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;</p>

<p>  (5)  Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individual’s family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and,</p>

<p>  (6)  Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.</p>

<p>Name and address of U.S. person organization providing this information:</p>

<p>________________________________________________</p>

<p><i>Introduction</i>.  Section 402 of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act (Public Law 99-399) provides that a “United States person” or a “qualified United States joint venture” must meet certain requirements, listed in sections 402(c)(2) and (3) of the Act, to be eligible to compete.  To assist business entities to determine whether they qualify as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person, guidance is hereby provided.  For ease of reference, the statutory language is quoted immediately before the definitions that apply to it.  Space for the required information is provided immediately following each definition.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>:  The Statement of Qualifications shall provide information correctly applicable to the U.S. person whose qualifications are being certified, and shall not include information pertaining to corporate affiliates or subsidiaries.  Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of any other legally dependent organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or other related organizations, must do so by way of a joint venture.   A prospective bidder/offeror may be an individual organization or firm, a formal joint venture in which the co-venturers have reduced their arrangement to writing, or a de facto joint venture where no formal agreement has been reached, but the offering entity relies upon the experience of a related U.S. firm that guarantees performance.  To be considered a “qualified United States joint venture person,” the joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. person listed in Section 402.  By signing this bid/proposal, the U.S. person co-venturer agrees to be individually responsible for performance of the contract, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.</p>

<p>  1.  Section 402(c)(2)(A):  “The term ‘United States person’ means a person which – (A) is incorporated or legally organized under the laws of the United States, including the District of Columbia, and local laws.”</p>

<p>Definitions for purposes of Section 402 determinations of eligibility -</p>

<p>  “Incorporated” means the successful <i>de jure</i> incorporation of a business organization pursuant to the laws of any United States jurisdiction or component thereof.</p>

<p>  “Legally organized” means the legally recognized existence of an organization other than a <i>de jure </i> corporation (e.g., a partnership) under the laws of any United States jurisdiction or component thereof.  Only organizations that have a legal status, including the right to bring suit, to sign contracts, and to hold property under the law of the jurisdiction where they are doing business will qualify as legally organized.  A natural person who is a United States citizen acting in her or her entrepreneurial capacity will be deemed to be a “person legally organized” within the scope of this definition, provided that the prospective bidder/offeror holds all required licenses to do business in the jurisdiction where he or she is located.</p>

<p>  “United States” means any jurisdiction that is one of the fifty States, the  District of Columbia, a United States territory, a United States possession, or the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Marina Islands.</p>

<p>Definitions for purposes of Section 402 determinations of eligibility -</p>

The named location must be a United States jurisdiction from which a tax return has been filed or will be filed during the calendar year in which the prospective bidder/offeror submits this bid/offer.</p>

<p>  “United States” means any jurisdiction that is one of the fifty States, the  District of Columbia, a United States territory, a United States possession, or the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Marina Islands.</p>

<p>  Question 2(a).  The organization seeking eligibility has its principal place of business in what city and state?</p>

<p>  Question 2(b).  What kind of tax return was or will be filed, and in what jurisdiction, during the current calendar year?  </p>

<p>(i) Jurisdiction:____________________ (e.g., federal, state, city)</p>

<p>(ii) Type of return (e.g., income tax, franchise tax, etc.).  Include all that apply:___________________________</p>

<p>________________________________</p>

<p>  3.  Section 402(c)(2)(C):  “The term ‘United States person’ means a person which has been incorporated or legally organized in the United States – </p>

<p>  (i) for more than 5 (five) years before the issuance date of the invitation for bids or request for proposals with respect to a construction project under subsection (a)(1); and,</p>

<p>  (ii)  for more than 2 (two) years before the issuance date of the invitation for bids or request for proposals with respect to a construction or design project abroad that involves technical security under subsection (a)(2).”</p>

<p>Definitions for purposes of Section 402 determinations of eligibility -</p>

<p>  “Has been incorporated or legally organized” means that the organization can show continuity as an ongoing business.  Organizations that have changed only their names meet the continuity requirement of this subsection.  Organizations that have been bought, sold, merged, or otherwise substantially altered or enlarged their principal business activities will have the burden of proving that there have been ongoing operations by the same business entity for the required period of time.  If the successor entity has acquired all of the assets and liabilities of the predecessor business and the predecessor business has no further existence, the successor may claim the incorporation date of the predecessor.  In any other circumstance, the prospective bidder/offeror must show that the law of the jurisdiction in which it operates regards the prospective bidder/offeror as the complete successor in interest of the predecessor business for purpose of contractual obligations.</p>

<p>  “Issuance date” means the date in Block 5 of the Standard Form 33 accompanying this solicitation.</p>

<p>  “Years” means calendar years measured from day of the month to day of the month.  For example, January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 is one calendar year, as is July 1, 2002 through July 1, 2003.</p>

<p>  (i)  On what date was the organization seeking eligibility incorporated or legally organized? ______________________</p>

<p>  (ii)  If this date is less than the required number of years before the issuance date, on the basis of what documentation does the organization seeking eligibility claim that it has been in business for the requisite period of time? __________________  (Identify, and forward copies as an Attachment to this Statement.  This material may include such items as certificates of incorporation, partnership agreements, resolutions of boards of directors, etc.).</p>

<p>Definitions for purposes of Section 402 determination of eligibility -</p>

<p>  “Administrative and technical, professional, or construction services” means the kind of work in which the prospective bidder/offeror is interested.  If the proposed contract is for construction management services, the prospective bidder/offeror will be expected to demonstrate construction management expertise.  In general, ‘administrative’ means the capacity or ability to manage; ‘technical’ means the specific skills peculiar to the type of work required; ‘professional’ means expert services resulting from advanced training in the type of work required; and ‘construction’ experience if it has not directly performed all of the actual construction activities.  Thus, an entity whose only construction work experience was performed by its legally distinct subsidiary or parent will not be considered to have construction experience.</p>

<p>  “Complexity” means the physical size and technical size and demands of the project.</p>

<p>  “Performed” means projects that have been fully completed by the prospective bidder/offeror and accepted by the owner or other party to the transaction.  Projects still in progress have not yet been performed for purposes of this definition.</p>

<p>  “Type of construction” means the overall nature of the facilities to be built, including the kinds of materials to be used.  Thus, if the contract will require the construction of a multi-story office building, the prospective bidder/offeror will be expected to demonstrate experience with facilities of this type.</p>

<p>  “Value” means the total contract price of the project, not to the profit or loss to the bidder/offeror.</p>

<p>  “Within the United States” means a United States jurisdiction that is the place where the subject matter of the contract or other arrangement was in fact completed.  It does not mean the place where the contract or other arrangement was negotiated or signed.  The term “United States” means any jurisdiction that is one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, a United States territory, a United States possession, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<p>  Question 4:  List on this page, and an attachment (if necessary), one or more similar projects completed by the prospective bidder/offeror.  For each project, provide the following information:</p>

<p>Location:___________________________________________ (city and state)</p>

<p>Complexity: ____________________________________(office building, etc.)</p>

<p>  5.  Section 402(c)(2)(E): “The term ‘United States person’ means a person which – with respect to a construction project under subsection (a)(1) – has achieved a total business volume equal to or greater than the value of the project being bid in 3 years of the 5-year period before the date specified in subparagraph (C)(i).”</p>

<p>Definitions of purposes of Section 402 determination of eligibility -</p>

<p>  “3 years of the 5-year period before the date specified in subparagraph (C)(i)” means the three to five calendar year period immediately preceding the issuance<font color="#ff0000"> </font>date of this solicitation.</p>

<p>  “Total business volume” means the U.S. dollar value of the gross income or receipts reported by the prospective bidder/offeror on its annual federal income tax returns.</p>

<p>  “Years” means the business year of the prospective bidder/offeror, as reflected on its annual federal income tax returns.</p>

<p>  Question 5:  Please complete the information below for at least three of the five listed years.</p>

<p>The gross receipts for the business year:  (list year and amount)</p>

<p>The gross receipts for the business year:  (list year and amount)</p>

<p>  6.  Section 402(c)(2)(F):  “The term ‘United States person’ means a person which – (i) employs United States citizens in at least 80 percent of its principal management positions in the United States; (ii) employs United States citizens in more than half of its permanent, full-time positions in the United States; and (iii) will employ United States citizens in at least 80 percent of the supervisory positions on the foreign buildings office project site.”</p>

The term full-time refers to positions in which the occupants are expected to and ordinarily work 40 hours a week.  The term ‘permanent, full-time positions’ covers the portion of the prospective bidder’s/offeror’s workforce that continues to be employed without regard to the fluctuating requirements of production or projects.</p>

<p>  “Principal management positions” refers to chief operating officer and those management officials reporting directly to him or her.  In the case of a partnership, the term refers to every general partner.  In the case of a corporation, the term refers to those officers of the corporation who are active in running its day-to-day operations.  Members of corporation boards of directors who do not have operational responsibilities do not occupy “principal management positions” simply by virtue of their service on the board.  In all cases, the term “principal management positions” also includes the position or positions held by the individual or individuals who will have primary corporate management oversight responsibility for this contract if the prospective bidder/offeror is awarded the contract.  Each prospective bidder/offeror is responsible for listing all of its principal management positions and identifying their current occupants by name and citizenship.</p>

<p>Definitions for purposes of Section 402 determinations of eligibility -</p>

<p>Definitions for purposes of Section 402 determinations of eligibility -</p>

Prospective bidders/offerors are advised that a joint venture may not be acceptable to projects requiring a Department of Defense facility security clearance because each co-venturer may post particular problems in obtaining security clearances.  To be acceptable, all members of a joint venture must be individually and severally liable for the full performance of and resolution of any and all matters arising out of the contract, notwithstanding any provision of the joint venture agreement of law of the jurisdiction under which the joint venture was created.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR PURPOSES OF OBTAINING PREFERENCE AS A U.S. PERSON (22 U.S.C. 4864)</p>

<p>Name and address of U.S. person organization providing this information:</p>

<p>__________________________________________</p>

<p><i>Introduction</i>.  Section 136 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, Public Law 101-246 (22 U.S.C. 4864), as amended, provides that a “United States person” or a “qualified United States joint venture” must meet certain requirements, listed in the Act, to be eligible for the statutory preference.  To assist business entities to determine whether they qualify as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person entitled to preference under Section 136, guidance is hereby provided.  Only those prospective offerors submitting a properly completed and certified Volume 5 with their initial proposals will be considered in the determination of eligibility for assignment of preference as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person.  For ease of reference, statutory language is quoted immediately before the definitions that apply to it.  Space for the required information is provided immediately following each definition.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>:  The Statement of Qualifications shall provide information correctly applicable to the U.S. person whose qualifications are being certified, and shall not include information pertaining to corporate affiliates or subsidiaries.  Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of another organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or local national or offshore organizations, must do so by way of a joint venture.  The contract resulting from this solicitation shall not allow subcontracting.  A prospective offeror may be a sole proprietorship, a formal joint venture in which the co-venturers have reduced their arrangement to writing, or a de facto joint venture with no written agreement.  To be considered a “qualified joint venture person,” the joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. joint venture person listed in Section 136.  By signing this proposal, the U.S. person co-venturer agrees to be individually responsible for performance of the contract, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.</p>

<p>  1.  Section 136(d)(1):  “The term ‘United States person’ means a person which – (A) is incorporated or legally organized under the laws of the United States, including the laws of any State, locality, or the District of Columbia.”</p>

<p>Definitions for purposes of Section 136 determinations of eligibility -</p>

<p>  “Incorporated” means the state of legal recognition as an artificial person that may be afforded to a business entity pursuant to the laws of any United States jurisdiction or component thereof.</p>

<p>  “Legally organized” means the state of legal recognition that may be afforded to a business entity that is other than a corporation pursuant to the laws of any United States jurisdiction or component thereof.  This is the least form of legal recognition that will qualify an offeror for this preference.  Only those prospective offerors that have legal status, including the right to bring suit, to sign contracts, and to hold property under the law of the jurisdiction under which they are doing business will qualify as legally organized.  A natural person who is a United States citizen acting in her or her entrepreneurial capacity will be deemed to be a “person legally organized” within the scope of this definition, provided that the prospective offeror holds all required licenses to do business in the jurisdiction he or she is located.</p>

<p>  “United States” means any jurisdiction that is one of the fifty States, the  District of Columbia, a United States territory, a United States possession, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Northern Marina Islands.</p>

<p>  Question 1.  The organization seeking eligibility under Section 136 is  o incorporated or is  o legally organized under the laws of what jurisdiction?</p>

The named location must be a United States jurisdiction in which the prospective offeror may bring suit and be sued and in which service of process shall be accepted.</p>

<p>  Question 2(a).  The organization seeking eligibility has its principal office in what city and state?</p>

<p>________________________________  </p>

<p>  Question 2(b).  What kind of tax return was or will be filed, and in what jurisdiction, during the current calendar year?  The jurisdiction identified herein need not be the same jurisdiction identified in Question 2(a).</p>

<p>________________________________</p>

<p>  3.

<p>Definitions for purposes of Section 136 determinations of eligibility -</p>

<p>  “Has been incorporated or legally organized” means that the organization can show continuity as an ongoing business.  Organizations that have changed only their names meet the continuity requirement of this subsection.  Organizations that have been bought, sold, merged, or otherwise substantially altered or enlarged their principal business activities will have the burden of proving that there have been ongoing operations by the same business entity for the required period of time.  If the successor entity has acquired all of the assets and liabilities of the predecessor entity and the predecessor entity has no further existence, the successor may claim the incorporation or legal organization date of the predecessor.

<p>  “Issuance date” means the date in Block 5 of the Standard Form 33 accompanying this solicitation.</p>

<p>  “Years” means calendar years measured from day of the month to day of the month.  For example, January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 is one calendar year, as is July 1, 2002 through July 1, 2003.</p>

<p>  (i)  On what date was the organization seeking eligibility incorporated or legally organized? ______________________</p>

Contracts need not have been with the U.S. Government.</p>

<p>  “Security services” means work of a kind as to fall within or compare closely with those described in the Statement of Work in Section C of this solicitation.  An entity whose only security services experience was performed by its legally distinct parent or subsidiary organization will not be considered to have security services experience.</p>

The place where the contract or other arrangement was negotiated or signed is not relevant to this definition.</p>

The contract and, as necessary, order numbers, net and gross weights in kilograms shall be stenciled on the same side.  However, if the size of the box is too small to accommodate all stenciling on one side, the contract and order numbers and weights may be stenciled on the side opposite that used for the export marks and case number.</p>
