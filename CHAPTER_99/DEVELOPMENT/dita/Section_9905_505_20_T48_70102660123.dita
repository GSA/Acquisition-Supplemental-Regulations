			The purpose of this Cost Accounting Standard is to facilitate the negotiation, audit, administration and settlement of contracts by establishing guidelines covering: 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) Identification of costs specifically described as unallowable, at the time such costs first become defined or authoritatively designated as unallowable, and 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) The cost accounting treatment to be accorded such identified unallowable costs in order to promote the consistent application of sound cost accounting principles covering all incurred costs. 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) The Standard is predicated on the proposition that costs incurred in carrying on the activities of an educational institution - regardless of the allowability of such costs under Government contracts - are allocable to the cost objectives with which they are identified on the basis of their beneficial or causal relationships. 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) This Standard does not govern the allowability of costs. This is a function of the appropriate procurement or reviewing authority.
