The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Subcontracts.</em> The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms “contract,” “contractor,” and “Contracting Officer” shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Prime Contractor Responsibilities.</em> The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

                                    <p class="p List1">(b) The Government intends to award [specify “a single contract” or “multiple contracts”] in response to the solicitation. The Government reserves the right not to award a contract depending on the quality of the proposals submitted and the availability of funds.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) Initial Evaluation of Proposals. All offers received will be evaluated in accordance with the stated evaluation factors. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions based solely upon initial proposals. Therefore, offerors should ensure that their initial proposal constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical solution being proposed.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">If award is not made upon initial proposals, then the Contracting Officer will establish a competitive range comprised of the most highly rated proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly-rated proposals. Only those offerors in the competitive range will be offered an opportunity to participate further in the procurement.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">(2) Discussions/Final Proposal Revisions. The Contracting Officer will engage in discussions with all offerors in the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306. At the conclusion of discussions, a final common cut-off date for submission of final proposal revisions will be established. Those offerors remaining in the competitive range will be notified to submit Final Proposal Revisions.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">(3) Final Evaluation of Offers. A final proposal evaluation will be performed after receipt of Final Proposal Revisions.</p>

</p>
                                    <p class="p P">Based upon the results of the integrated assessment of the technical and cost/price proposals, the Government may make an award to other than the lowest-priced offeror or the offeror with the highest technical score if the source selection official determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) Technical Evaluation Factors.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">Factor 1 - TECHNICAL APPROACH. The proposal will be evaluated on how the offeror intends to organize, staff and manage the contract and the means that will be used to accomplish the contract requirements. The degree to which the proposal demonstrates an understanding of the requirements will be evaluated, as well as the offeror's planned management of consultants and subcontractors, if applicable.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">Factor 2 - EXPERIENCE. The offeror's background, experience, and qualifications will be assessed to determine the likelihood that that offeror can successfully perform the contract requirements and the degree of the risk of non-performance.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">Factor 3 - KEY PERSONNEL. The education, experience, and accomplishments of key personnel will be evaluated to determine the degree to which they possess the qualifications to perform their proposed duties under the contract.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">Factor 4 - PAST PERFORMANCE. The offeror's past performance on related contracts will be evaluated to determine, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, effective management of subcontractors, cost management, level of communication between the contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">The Government reserves the right to assess the past performance of proposed subcontractors.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">The Government will use its discretion to determine the sources of past performance information used in the evaluation, and the information may be obtained from references provided by the offeror, the agency's knowledge of contractor performance, other government agencies or commercial entities, or past performance databases.
</p>
                                    <p class="p P">If an offeror does not have a history of relevant contract experience, or if past performance information is not available, the offeror will receive a neutral past performance rating; however, an offeror without a history of relevant experience may receive a lowered rating for the experience evaluation factor.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(b) Cost/Price Evaluation.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) The proposed prices/costs will be evaluated but not scored. The cost evaluation will determine whether the proposed costs are realistic, complete, and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements. Proposed costs must be entirely compatible with the technical proposal.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) The Government may use the results of cost/price realism analysis to adjust the offeror's proposal to a most probable cost to the Government. The analysis may include information from a government auditing agency, Government technical personnel, and other sources.</p>

</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">General.</em> In addition to the information required by CAR 1352.215-70, the cost/price proposal must contain an explanation of the offeror's and proposed subcontractors' fully burdened rates, including direct salary rates, overhead rates, and profit; and information regarding other direct costs.
</p>
                                    <p class="p Runin List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Specific Requirements.</em> 
				</p>
<p class="p List2">(1) 
			Direct Salary Rates: The offeror shall list the categories of professional or technical personnel required to perform the Statement of Work. A brief definition of the education and experience requirements which qualify an employee for inclusion in a listed category should be provided. Further, if some proposed labor categories are classified by multiple grades within a given discipline (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> Architect I and II, or Senior and Junior Engineer), a brief explanation as to how they are differentiated shall be provided.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) The offeror, and major subcontractors, should provide individual rates for key personnel. Designation of an individual as a key person is subject to agreement of the parties. Where no key personnel are listed, category average rates are appropriate. Rates should be provided by year for the life of the contract. If rates are escalated, the degree (percent) and methodology must be shown. Escalation increases should reflect recent experience or established personnel policy. Types of salary increases given - merit, cost of living, <em class="ph i">etc.</em> - should be discussed.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Overhead Costs. Generally, the offeror's accounting system and estimating practices will determine the method used to allocate overhead costs. The offeror's established practices, if in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, will be accepted. Proposed overhead rates should represent the offeror's best estimate of the rates to be experienced during the contract period as projected by company budgets or by recent experience adjusted for factors which will influence trends. A narrative statement outlining the offeror's policies and practices for accumulating overhead costs and the method used to compute the proposed rate or rates is required. In the case of multi-branch firms, joint ventures or affiliates, it is expected that overhead costs applicable to the specific location(s) where work is to be performed will be proposed. Company-wide, joint venture, or affiliate rate averages may not be appropriate. The rates should be tailored to the work location(s).
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) Profit. 
				</p>
<p class="p List3">(i) 
			A fair and reasonable provision for profit cannot be made by simply applying a certain predetermined percentage to the total estimated cost. Rather, profit should be established as a percentage/dollar amount after considering such factors as:

                                    <p class="p List3">(F) Other criteria discussed in FAR 15.404-4.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(ii) Separate percentage rates for profit are also required for major subcontractors.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(5) Markup. The offeror may request a markup on subcontract labor. If it does so, it should state the percentage and provide a justification for that figure.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(6) Other Direct Costs. The offeror shall briefly describe the following:
</p>
                                    <p class="p List3">(i) 
			Travel/Subsistence costs;

</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(iii) How subcontracting costs were analyzed.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(c) Audit Reports. If the offeror or any subcontractor has been audited by a Government agency within the last two years, or has approved indirect cost rates, provide a copy of the audit report, or, if not available, the name, address, and telephone number of the audit office. Similarly, information on any Government-approved indirect cost rates should be provided.</p>

</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) All work and material shall be subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer or duly authorized representative. Work shall be performed in accordance with the plans and specifications of this contract as modified by any contract modification.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(b) Unless otherwise specifically provided for in the contract, all operational practices of the contractor and all workmanship and material, equipment and articles used in the performance of work shall be in accordance with American Bureau of Shipping “Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels”, U.S. Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F), U.S. Coast Guard Electrical Engineering Regulations (46 CFR Subchapter J), and U.S. Public Health Service “Handbook on Sanitation of Vessel Construction”, in effect at the time of the contract award; and the best commercial maritime practices, except where military specifications are specified, in which case such standards of material and workmanship shall be followed.

In case any material or workmanship furnished by the contractor is found to be defective prior to redelivery of the vessel, or not in accordance with the requirements of the contract, the Government shall have the right prior to redelivery of the vessel to reject such material or workmanship, and to require its correction or replacement by the contractor at the contractor's cost and expense. This Government right is in addition to its rights under any Guarantee clause in this contract. If the contractor fails to proceed promptly with the replacement or correction of such material or workmanship, as required by the Contracting Officer, the Government may, by contract or otherwise, replace or correct such material or workmanship and charge to the contractor the excess cost to the Government. The contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the work specified in the contract. Records of all inspection work by the contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of two (2) years after delivery of the vessel to the Government.

The welder's qualifications shall be appropriate for the particular service application, filler material type, position of welding, and welding process involved in the work being undertaken. A welder may be required to re-qualify if the Contracting Officer believes there is a reasonable doubt concerning the welder's ability. Welders' qualifications for this purpose shall be governed by the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F). When a welding process other than manual shielded arc is proposed or required, the contractor or fabricator shall submit procedure qualification tests for approval prior to production welding. Procedure qualification tests shall be conducted in accordance with the United States Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F).
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(e) The contractor shall exercise reasonable care to protect the vessel from fire, and the contractor shall maintain a reasonable system of inspection over the activities of welders, burners, riveters, painters, plumbers and similar workers, particularly where such activities are undertaken in the vicinity of the vessel's fuel oil tanks, magazines or storerooms containing flammable material. A reasonable number of hose lines shall be maintained by the contractor ready for immediate use on the vessel at all times while the vessel is berthed alongside the contractor's pier or in dry dock or on a marine railway. All tanks or bilge areas under alteration or repair shall be cleaned, washed, and steamed out or otherwise made safe by the contractor if and to the extent necessary as required by good marine practice or by current Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) shall be furnished with a “gas free” or “safe for hot work” or “safe for workers” certificate before any hot work or entry is done. Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the contractor shall at all times maintain a reasonable fire watch about the vessel, including a fire watch on the vessel while work is being performed thereon.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(f) The contractor shall place proper safeguards and/or effect such safety precautions as necessary, including suitable and sufficient lighting, for the prevention of accidents or injury to persons or property during the prosecution of work under this contract and/or from time of receipt of the vessel until acceptance by the Government of the work performed.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(g) Except as otherwise provided in this contract, when the vessel is in the custody of the contractor or in dry dock or on a marine railway and the temperature becomes as low as 35 degrees Fahrenheit, the contractor shall keep all pipelines, fixtures, traps, tanks, and other receptacles on the vessel drained to avoid damage from freezing, or if this is not practicable, the vessel shall be kept heated to prevent such damage. The vessel's stern tube and propeller hubs shall be protected from frost damage by applied heat through the use of a salamander or other proper means, as approved by the COR.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(h) Whenever practicable, the work shall be performed in a manner which does not interfere with the berthing and messing of personnel attached to the vessel. The contractor shall ensure that assigned personnel have access to the vessel at all times. It is understood that such personnel will not interfere with the work or the contractor's workers.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(i) The Government does not guarantee the correctness of the dimensions, sizes, and shapes shown in any sketches, drawings, plans or specifications prepared or furnished by the Government. Prior to submitting an offer, it is the responsibility of the bidder/offeror to verify the dimensions, sizes, and shapes in materials provided by the Government. Where practical, the Government will make the vessel available for inspection prior to bid opening or the date for receipt of proposals.

                                    <p class="p HD1">Additional Item Requirements (Air) - Growth Work (APR 2010)
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule:
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging.

For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals:
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List2">(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.</p>

If the Government furnished property is not furnished in the time stated in the contract, or, if a date is not specified, and the late delivery does not give the contractor sufficient time to enable the contractor to meet required contract delivery or performance dates, the contractor shall notify the Government in writing of the late delivery. Notification shall include cost and schedule impacts, including delays and disruptions to schedules. This notification shall be submitted as soon as practical or known.

</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(a) The contractor shall exercise reasonable care and use its best efforts to prevent accidents, injury or damage to all employees, persons and property, in and about the work, and to the vessel or part thereof upon which work is done.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(b) The contractor shall be responsible for and make good at its own cost and expense any and all loss of or damage of whatsoever nature to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo, and Government-owned material and equipment for the repair, completion, alteration of or addition to the vessel in the possession of the contractor, whether at the plant or elsewhere, arising or growing out of the performance of the work, except where the contractor can affirmatively show that such loss or damage was due to causes beyond the contractor's control, was proximately caused by the fault or negligence of agents or employees of the Government, or which loss or damage the contractor by exercise of reasonable care was unable to prevent. However, the contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the contractor. To induce the contractor to perform the work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the contractor's aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and Government-owned materials and equipment, shall in no event exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00. As to the contractor, the Government assumes the risk of loss or damage to the Government-owned vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and said Government-owned materials and equipment in excess of $1,000,000.00. This assumption of risk includes but is not limited to loss or damage from negligence of whatsoever degree of the contractor's servants, employees, agents or subcontractors, but specifically excludes loss or damage from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of contractor's personnel, who have supervision or direction of all or substantially all of the contractor's business, or all or substantially all of the contractor's operation at any one plant. However, as to such risk assumed and borne by the Government, the Government shall be subrogated to any claim, demand or cause of action against third persons which exists in favor of the contractor, and the contractor shall, if required, execute a formal assignment or transfer of claims, demands or causes of action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall create or give rise to any right, privilege or power in any person except the contractor, nor shall any person (except the contractor) be or become entitled thereby to proceed directly against the Government, or join the Government as a co-defendant in any action against the contractor brought to determine the contractor's liability, or for any other purpose.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(c) The contractor indemnifies and holds harmless the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and the vessel against all suits, actions, claims, costs or demands (including without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury and property damage) to which the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, or the vessel may be subject or put by reason of damage or injury (including death) to the property or person of anyone other than the Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and personnel, or the vessel, arising or resulting in whole or in part from the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the contractor, or any subcontractor, its or their servants, agents or employees; provided that the contractor's obligation to indemnify under this paragraph (c) shall not exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence in respect of any one vessel. Such indemnity shall include, without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands of any kind whatsoever, resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring during the period of performance of work on the vessel or within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel. Any new equipment warranties that extend beyond the 90 days after redelivery of the vessel shall be assigned to the Government upon redelivery of the vessel. With respect to any such suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring after the expiration of such period, the rights and liabilities of the Government and the contractor shall be as determined by other provisions of this contract and by law; provided that such indemnity shall apply to death occurring after such period which results from any personal injury received during the period covered by the contractor's indemnity as provided herein.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(d) The contractor shall, at its own expense, procure, and thereafter maintain such casualty, accident and liability insurance, in such forms and amounts as may be approved by the Contracting Officer, insuring the performance of its obligations under paragraph (c) of this clause. In addition, the contractor shall at its own expense procure and thereafter maintain such ship repairer's legal liability insurance as may be necessary to insure the contractor against its liability as ship repairer in the amount of $1,000,000.00, or the value of the vessel as determined by the Contracting Officer, whichever is the lesser, with respect to each vessel on which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies, however, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, such insurance need not be procured whenever the job order requires work on parts of a vessel only and the work is to be performed at a plant other than the site of the vessel. Further, the contractor shall procure and maintain in force Worker's Compensation Insurance (or its equivalent) covering its employees engaged in the work and shall ensure the procurement and maintenance of such insurance by all subcontractors engaged in the work. The contractor shall provide evidence of insurance as required by the Government.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(e) The contractor shall receive no allowance in the contract price for inclusion of any premium expense or charge for any reserve made on account of self-insurance for coverage against any risk assumed by the Government under this clause.
</p>
                                    <p class="p List1">(f) As soon as practicable after the occurrence of any loss or damage, the risk of which the Government has assumed, written notice of the damage shall be given by the contractor to the Contracting Officer. The notice shall contain full particulars of the loss or damage. If claim is made or suit is brought thereafter against the contractor as the result or because of such event, the contractor shall immediately deliver to the Government every demand, notice, summons or other process received by it or its representatives. The contractor shall cooperate with the Government, and, upon the Government's request, shall assist in effecting settlements, securing and giving evidence; obtaining the attendance of witnesses, and other assistance required in the conduct of suits. The Government shall pay to the contractor the expense, other than the cost of maintaining the contractor's usual organization, incurred in this assistance. Except at its own cost, the contractor shall not voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense not imperative for the protection of the vessel or vessels at the time of the event.</p>
