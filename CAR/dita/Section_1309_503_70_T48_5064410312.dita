      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) The need for a waiver of an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) may be identified by the contracting officer or by a written request submitted by an offeror or contractor. The contracting officer shall review all of the relevant facts and shall refer the matter to the Senior Bureau Procurement Official, who shall make a written recommendation to the Head of Contracting Activity whether a waiver should be granted to allow for a contract award or for continuation of an existing contract.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) Criteria for Waiver of OCIs. Issuance of a waiver shall be limited to those situations in which:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) The work to be performed under contract is vital to the agency;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) There is no party other than the conflicted party that can perform the contract at issue; and
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) Contractual and/or technical review and supervision methods cannot be employed to mitigate the conflict.
