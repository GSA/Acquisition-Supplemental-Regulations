         <p outputclass="List1">(a) <i>Numbering.</i> Where DOLAR implements the FAR, the implementing part, subpart, section or subsection of the DOLAR is numbered and captioned, to the extent feasible, the same as the FAR part, subpart, section or subsection being implemented, except that the section or subsection being implemented is preceded with a 29 or a 290 such that there will always be four numbers to the left of the first decimal. For example, the DOLAR implementation of FAR l.105-l is shown as 290l.105-1 and the DOLAR implementation of FAR subpart 24.1 is shown as DOLAR subpart 2924.1. Material which supplements the FAR is assigned the subsection numbers 70 and up. For example, the DOL regulation governing appointment and termination of contracting officers' technical representatives is identified as <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly"

         <p outputclass="List1">(b) References to FAR materials within the DOLAR will include the acronym FAR and the identifying number, for example, FAR l.104-2(c)(2). References to DOLAR materials within the DOLAR simply cite the identifying number, for example, 2901.104-2(c)(2).
