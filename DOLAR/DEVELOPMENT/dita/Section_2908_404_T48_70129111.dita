         <p xtrc="P">Small business considerations, procedures regarding both prime and subcontracting, and clearances specified in DOLAR 2919 apply to GSA Federal Supply Schedule Orders above the simplified acquisition threshold. Procedures to be followed may be modified by the Office of Small Business Program as appropriate in order to comply with GSA Federal Supply Schedule procedures (e.g., first tier contracts may be required to report their commercial subcontracting goals to the DOL Office of Small Business Programs).
