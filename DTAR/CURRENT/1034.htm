<p><i><u>Core Earned Value Management</u></i> is a process for ensuring that the contractor’s self validated earned value management system is capable of producing earned value management data and meets, at a minimum, the following core ANSI/EIA Standard-748 criteria: </p>

<p>(1) (ANSI #1) Define the authorized work elements for the program. A work breakdown structure (WBS), tailored for effective internal management control, is commonly used in this process. </p>

<p>(2) (ANSI #2) Identify the program organizational structure including the major subcontractors responsible for accomplishing the authorized work, and define the organizational elements in which work will be planned and controlled. </p>

<p>(3) (ANSI #3) Provide for the integration of the company’s planning, scheduling, budgeting, work authorization, and cost accumulation processes with each other, and as appropriate, the program WBS and the program organizational structure. </p>

<p>(4) (ANSI #6) Schedule the authorized work in a manner that describes the sequence of work and identifies significant task interdependencies required to meet the needs of the program. </p>

<p>(5) (ANSI #7) Identify physical products, milestones, technical performance goals, or other indicators that will be used to measure progress. </p>

<p>(6) (ANSI #8) Establish and maintain a time-phased budget baseline, at the control account level, against which program performance can be measured. Initial budgets established for performance measurement will be based on either internal management goals or the external customer negotiated target cost including estimates for authorized but vaguely defined work.  Budget for far-term efforts may be held in higher-level accounts until an appropriate time for allocation at the control account level. On government contracts, if an over-target baseline is used for performance measurement reporting purposes, prior notification must be provided to the customer. </p>

<p>(7) (ANSI #16) Record direct costs in a manner consistent with the budgets in a formal system controlled by the general books of account. </p>

<p>(8) (ANSI #22) At least on a monthly basis, generate the following information at the control account and other levels as necessary for management control using actual cost data from, or reconcilable with, the accounting system: </p>

<p>(i) Comparison of the amount of planned budget and the amount of budget earned for work accomplished. This comparison provides the schedule variance. </p>

<p>(ii) Comparison of the amount of the budget earned and the actual (applied where appropriate) direct costs for the same work. This comparison provides the cost variance. </p>

<p>(9) (ANSI #27) Develop revised estimates of cost at completion based on performance to date, commitment values for material, and estimates of future conditions. Compare this information with the performance measurement baseline to identify variances at completion important to management and any applicable customer reporting requirements, including statements of funding requirements. </p>

<p>(10) (ANSI #28) Incorporate authorized changes in a timely manner, recording the effects of such changes in budgets and schedules. In the directed effort prior to negotiation of a change, base such revisions on the amount estimated and budgeted to the program organizations. <i><u>Development, Modernization, Enhancement (DME) </u></i>is the portion of an IT investment/project which deals with developing and implementing new or enhanced technology in support of an agency’s mission.   </p>

<p><i><u>Major acquisitions for development</u></i> are defined as contracts, awarded in support of one or more Major IT investments with DME activities, which meet the contract threshold for fully applying <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR34.doc#s342. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/34.htm#P63_10216">FAR 34.2</a></u></font> procedures. </p>

<p><i><u>Performance-based acquisition management </u></i>means a documented, systematic process for program management, which includes integration of program scope, schedule and cost objectives, establishment of a baseline plan for accomplishment of program objectives, and use of earned value techniques for performance measurement during execution of the program.  A performance-based acquisition (as defined in <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR37.doc#b37101. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/37.htm#P6_1070">FAR 37.101</a></u></font>) or an acquisition with a defined quality assurance plan that includes performance standards/measures should be the basis for monitoring the contractor. </p>

<p><a name="P24_4415"></a><b>1034.004 Acquisition strategy.  </b></p>

<p>(a) A program manager’s acquisition strategy written at the system or investment level in accordance with <font color="#0000ff"><u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- .../Far/FAR07.doc#b7103. --><a href="../../far2afmcfars/fardfars/Far/07.htm#P27_3064">FAR 7.103(</a></u></font>e) shall include at a minimum: </p>

<p>(1) The relationship of each individual acquisition (Contract, Delivery Order, Task Order, or Interagency Agreement) to the overall investment requirements and management structure; </p>

<p>(2) What work is being performed in-house (by government personnel) versus contracted out for the investment; </p>

<p>(3) A description of the effort, by acquisition, and the plans to include required  clauses in the acquisitions; </p>

<p>(4) A timetable of major acquisition award and administration activities, including plans for contract transitions; </p>

<p>(5) An investment/system surveillance plan; </p>

<p>(6) Financial and human resource requirements to manage the acquisition processes through the investment lifecycle; </p>

<p>(7) Consideration of optimal contract types, including considerations of performance based approaches, small business utilization, Section 508, etc.; and </p>

<p>(8) Assurances that the acquisition strategy section and supporting acquisition plans will maximize competition, including enabling downstream competition through avoidance of vendor “lock in”. </p>

<p>(b) The acquisition strategy shall be approved by a chartered interdisciplinary acquisition team that includes a representative of the procurement organization designated in accordance with bureau procedures. </p>
