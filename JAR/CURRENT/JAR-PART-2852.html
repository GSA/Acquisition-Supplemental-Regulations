</p>
                                 <p class="p P">“(A) If Contractor reasonably believes that the Government has violated the terms of this agreement with regard to the restrictions on authorized use and/or the number of authorized users, upon written request from Contractor, including an explanation of the basis for the request, DOJ will provide a redacted version of the Government's most recent Security Assessment and Authorization package (SAA) to Contractor on a confidential basis, so that Contractor may reasonably verify the Government's compliance with its obligations under this agreement. Contractor understands and agrees that the Government will remove or redact any information from the SAA that it reasonably believes may compromise (a) the security of the Government's information technology environment; (b) the confidentiality of any third-party proprietary or confidential information; (c) any confidential, sensitive law enforcement information; and (d) any other information that the Government believes may compromise a past, current, or prospective investigation, prosecution, or litigation. Notwithstanding the preceding, and subject to the Government's policies and procedures for such review, including but not limited to complying with all Government security requirements prior to being granted access to the Government's facilities, including the execution of appropriate confidentiality and/or non-disclosure agreements, the Government will arrange, upon Contractor's written request, for Contractor to view an un-redacted version of the SAA on Government premises. Contractor understands that Contractor will be provided a copy of the un-redacted SAA on Government premises only and that no un-redacted copy of the SAA, or any medium containing information relating to it, will be permitted to be removed from Government premises.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">(B) The Contractor also understands and agrees that the Contractor shall make a request under this paragraph no more than on an annual basis and only during the period of the contract, and that any activities performed by Contractor under this clause will be performed at Contractor's expense, without reimbursement by the Government.

                                 <p class="p P">(C) Discrepancies found with regard to the restrictions on authorized use and/or the number of authorized users may result in a charge by Contractor to the Government. Any resulting invoice must comply with the proper invoicing and payment requirements specified in the contract. This charge, if disputed by the Government, will be resolved through the Disputes clause at 52.212-4(d); no payment obligation shall arise on the part of the Government until the conclusion of the dispute process.”

                                 <p class="p P">(xiii) <em class="ph i">Non-assignment.</em> This agreement may not be assigned, nor may any rights or obligations thereunder be delegated, without the Government's prior approval, except as expressly permitted under FAR 52.212-4 (b), Assignment.

Specifically, the parties agree that the party receiving confidential information may only disclose such information to its employees and contractors on a “need-to-know” basis to carry out the obligations of this contract or order, and that subcontractors performing under this Agreement are subject to the same stipulations provided in this provision. The parties also agree that this provision shall survive the termination of this contract or order, and any confidential information obtained or received which comes within these restrictions shall remain confidential, provided that the obligation to treat information as confidential shall not apply to information which is or becomes publicly available through no improper action of the receiving party; is or comes to be in the receiving party's possession independent of its relationship with the disclosing party; is developed by or becomes known to the receiving party without use of any confidential information of the disclosing party; or is obtained rightfully from a third party not bound by an obligation of confidentiality. Additionally, nothing in this contract or order shall restrict disclosure by the receiving party pursuant to any applicable law, including but not limited to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, <em class="ph i">et seq.,</em> or an order of any court of competent jurisdiction, provided that in either such case the receiving party gives prompt notice to the disclosing party to allow the disclosing party to interpose an objection to such disclosure, take action to assure confidential handling of the confidential information, or take such other action as it deems appropriate to protect its confidential information.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">(B) The Government considers and hereby identifies as confidential any and all information related to any inquiries and/or searches performed by the Government or by contractor at the Government's direction under this contract or order, including the subject of any such inquiry or search and any and all search terms, regardless of whether provided in writing or orally to Contractor, and Contractor agrees that it may only disclose such information to its employees and contractors on a “need-to-know” basis to carry out the obligations of this contract or order and that it will not share, reveal, divulge, disclose, disseminate, or publicize any such information to any third party except as provided in this provision without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. Contractor also understands and agrees that any subcontractors performing under this contract or order are subject to the same stipulations and that Contractor may be held responsible for any violations of confidentiality by a subcontractor.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">(C) These provisions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter an employee's obligations, rights, or liabilities created by existing statute or Executive order relating to (1) classified information, (2) communications to Congress, (3) the reporting to an Inspector General of a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or (4) any other whistleblower protection. The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by Executive orders and statutory provisions relating to whistleblower protection are incorporated into this contract and are controlling.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">(D) The Government may share the terms, conditions and prices set forth in this Order with, and provide a copy of the Order to, other Executive branch agencies of the U.S. Government, provided that the Government shall ensure that other Executive branch agencies to which it provides such information will be required to treat all such information consistent with terms and conditions set forth in this Order.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">(E) Notwithstanding anything in this agreement, the Government may retain any confidential information as required by law, regulation, or its internal document retention procedures for legal, regulatory, or compliance purposes; provided, however, that all such retained confidential information will continue to be subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Order.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">(xv) <em class="ph i">Authorized users.</em> Authorized users may include full and part-time employees of the Government, including those working at or from remote locations, and contractors and contractor employees working within the scope of their contract with the Government, including those at or from remote locations.

                                 <p class="p List2">(1) “Agency Protest Official” (APO) means the Deciding Official for a procurement protest filed with a contracting activity of DOJ when the contracting officer will not be the Deciding Official because of the protestor's election under JAR 2833.103(b)

The Deciding Official will be the contracting officer unless the protestor requests pursuant to JAR 2833.103(b) that the protest be decided by an individual above the level of the contracting officer, in which case the HCA will designate an APO to serve as the Deciding Official.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) “Interested Party” means an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

                                 <p class="p List2">(3) State whether the protestor chooses to have the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protestor is silent on this matter, the Contracting Officer will decide the protest.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Indicate whether the protestor prefers to make an oral or written presentation of arguments in support of the protest to the deciding official.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(v) Request for a ruling by the agency.

                                 <p class="p List1">(f) The Deciding Official may conduct a scheduling conference. The scheduling conference, if conducted, will establish deadlines for oral or written arguments in support of the agency protest and for agency officials to present information in response to the protest issues.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(g) Oral conferences may take place either by telephone or in person.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(h) The protestor has only one opportunity to support or explain the substance of its protest. DOJ procedures do not provide for any discovery. The deciding official may request additional information from the agency or the protestor. The deciding official will resolve the protest through informal presentations or meetings to the maximum extent practicable.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(i) A protestor may represent itself or be represented by legal counsel. The DOJ will not reimburse the protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.

The justification or determination shall be approved at a level above the Contracting Officer. The stay or suspension, unless over-ridden, remains in effect until the protest is decided, dismissed, or withdrawn.

The decision shall be written, and provided to the protestor using a method that provides for evidence of receipt.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(l) The DOJ may dismiss or stay proceedings on an agency protest if a protest on the same or similar basis is filed with a forum outside DOJ.</p>
