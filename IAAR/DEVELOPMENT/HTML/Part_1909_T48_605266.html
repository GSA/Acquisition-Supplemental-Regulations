			Contractors shall be given the opportunity to submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and arguments in opposition to a proposed debarment or suspension.

Hearings will be held before a three-person fact-finding board composed of one member each from the Office of General Counsel and Congressional Liaison, the Bureau of Management, and the Office of Contracts, other than the initiating officer. The fact-finding board shall deliver written findings to the Board Procurement Executive (together with a transcription of the proceedings, if made) within 10 calendar days after the hearing. The findings shall resolve any facts in dispute based on a preponderance of the evidence presented and determine whether a cause for debarment or suspension exists.
