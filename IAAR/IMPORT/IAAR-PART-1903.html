         <p class="p P">To avoid potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of preferential treatment, it is the Broadcasting Board of Governors policy not to award contracts, purchase orders, grants or cooperative agreements to Government employees or their family members or business concerns owned or controlled by Government employees or their family members. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Board Director or Board Procurement Executive and supported by written Findings and Determination. A contract with an employee for services may result in violation of the dual salary compensation statutes (5 U.S.C. 5533). Nothing in this paragraph is intended to render inapplicable the conflict of interest prohibition set out in 18 U.S.C. 208.

         <p class="p P">To avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of preferential treatment, purchase orders, contracts, grants or cooperative agreements with former employees of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, or with firms in which former employees or their family members are known to have controlling interest, may be entered into within two years following separation from employment only with the written approval of the Board Director. A written justification shall be made a part of the file. The justification must address the issue of conflict of interest and conclude that it does not exist; or that in spite of its existence, the Board's ability to meet its mission would be seriously harmed without the award.
