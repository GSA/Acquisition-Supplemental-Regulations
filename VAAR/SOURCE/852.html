  <p>**The unit price adjustment shall be rounded up or down, as in paragraph <a href="#85221671e1" title="View 852.216-71(e)(1)">(e)(1)</a> above, to match the number of decimal places in the original bid.</p>
  <p class="indent1"><a name="85221671e4"></a>(4) If the Adjusting Index went down for the second adjustment period, reflecting only a 3 percent Index Point Change increase  over the Base Index, the new price for this sample line item would be reduced for the second contract adjustment period from $26.14 to $25.75 as follows:&nbsp; $25 X .03 = $0.75, $25 + $0.75= $25.75.&nbsp; Note that the calculations for the second contract adjustment period are based on the original contract price for that contract term of $25.00.&nbsp; The contract price for this line item is modified to reflect this new price for the second contract adjustment period.</p>
