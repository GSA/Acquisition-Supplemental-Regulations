      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) While conflicts of interest may not presently exist, award of certain types of contracts may create potential future organizational conflicts of interest (see FAR 9.508 for examples). If a solicitation may create a potential future organizational conflict of interest, the contracting officer shall insert a provision in the solicitation imposing an appropriate restraint on the contractor's eligibility for award of contracts in the future. Under FAR 9.507-1, the restraint must be appropriate to the nature of the conflict and may exclude the contractor from award of one or more contracts in the future.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) The provision at 852.209-70, Organizational Conflicts of Interest, must be included in any solicitation for the services addressed in FAR 9.502.
