      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) The contracting officer shall consider SDVOSB set-asides before considering VOSB set-asides. Except as authorized by 813.106, 819.7007 and 819.7008, the contracting officer shall set-aside an acquisition for competition restricted to SDVOSB concerns upon a reasonable expectation that,
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) Offers will be received from two or more eligible SDVOSB concerns; and
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) Award will be made at a fair and reasonable price.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) When conducting SDVOSB set-asides, the contracting officer shall ensure:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) Eligibility is extended to businesses owned and operated by surviving spouses; and
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) Businesses are registered and verified as eligible in the VIP database prior to making an award.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(c) If the contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer at a fair and reasonable price from an eligible SDVOSB concern in response to a SDVOSB set-aside, the contracting officer should make an award to that concern. If the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from eligible SDVOSB concerns, the set-aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, set aside for VOSB competition, if appropriate.
