         <p outputclass="List1">(a) In addition to the Right of First Refusal of Employment clause specified in FAR 52.207-3, the contracting officer must include the clause “Report of Employment Under Commercial Activities” at 852.207-70 in all cost comparison solicitations where VA personnel may be displaced. This clause is primarily intended to verify that the contractor is meeting its obligation to provide Federal workers who are adversely affected by the contract award and who are qualified for the jobs the first opportunity for employment openings created by the contract.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) The Report of Employment Under Commercial Activities clause is also prescribed to avoid inappropriate severance payment. To implement the clause, the contracting officer (or COTR) must first obtain a list of Federal personnel who will be adversely affected as a result of the anticipated contract from the servicing Human Resources Service office. The list should be requested as soon as a preliminary determination is made to contract out a function subject to OMB Circular A-76. (Contracting officers may designate a COTR to coordinate the information and reporting requirements.)
