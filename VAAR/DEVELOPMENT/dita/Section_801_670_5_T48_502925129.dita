         <p outputclass="List1">(b) The VA Office of Inspector General may issue contracts for commercial items, including services, using a letter format (see FAR 12.204(a)), provided billing information and required clauses are included in the contract. If the dollar value of the acquisition will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, this is a deviation from the requirement to use Standard Form 1449 at FAR 12.204(a).
