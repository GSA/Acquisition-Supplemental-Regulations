      <conbody>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) Bidders must be qualified in accordance with procedures outlined in FAR subpart 9.1 and subpart 809.1 of this chapter.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) Management brokers are not acceptable bidders for a repair contract due to their close association on a fee basis with VA. This restriction also applies to any contracting firm in which the management broker has an interest and in which it could be presumed that the firm would have an advantage over the other bidders. This does not preclude the management broker from performing routine recurring maintenance or minor repairs. When seeking payment for maintenance or repairs, the management broker must establish that any charges are not in excess of the prevailing fees for similar services in the area.
