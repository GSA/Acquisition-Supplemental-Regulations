	<p class="indenta"><a name="871102a"></a>(a) Except as provided in this subpart, Directors, Loan Guaranty Officers, and Assistant Loan Guaranty Officers, VA Regional Offices, are authorized to approve a repair program for any VA property acquired under Chapter 37, Title 38, U.S.C., if the cost does not exceed $25,000.&nbsp; A repair program means the aggregate amount of the proposed contracts that are contemplated in a property analysis by the Loan Guaranty activity.</p>
	<p class="indenta"><a name="871102b"></a>(b) In cases where the expenditure is known or estimated to exceed $25,000, the Loan Guaranty Officer, or his or her designee, must forward the request, together with the loan guaranty folder, to the Under Secretary for Benefits for approval.</p>
	<p class="indenta"><a name="871102c"></a>(c) During the period when VA has assumed custody of the property from a holder and before its conveyance to VA under 38 CFR 36.4320, repairs not in excess of $3,500 are authorized, when appropriate to make the property ready for sale at an earlier date than would otherwise be possible if the repair program was delayed until VA acquired absolute title.&nbsp; In cases where the expenditure is known or estimated to exceed $3,500, the Loan Guaranty Officer, or his or her designee, must forward the request, together with the loan guarantee folder, to the Under Secretary for Benefits for approval.</p>
	<p class="indenta"><a name="871102d"></a>(d) The holder must not make repairs to a property when it has continued custody, except for emergency repairs not in excess of $500, unless the holder gives adequate notice to the Director, Regional Office.&nbsp; Emergency repairs means immediate action to preserve the property from serious damage or to correct a situation imminently dangerous to life or limb, including the initial cleanup of the property to prevent the risk of damage by fire or vandalism.</p>

	<p class="indenta"><a name="871104b"></a>(b) Management brokers are not acceptable bidders for a repair contract due to their close association on a fee basis with VA.&nbsp; This restriction also applies to any contracting firm in which the management broker has an interest and in which it could be presumed that the firm would have an advantage over the other bidders.&nbsp; This does not preclude the management broker from performing routine recurring maintenance or minor repairs.&nbsp; When seeking payment for maintenance or repairs, the management broker must establish that any charges are not in excess of the prevailing fees for similar services in the area.</p>

	<p><a name="871107"></a><strong><u>871.107&nbsp; Stipulations against liens.</u></strong></p>
	<p class="indenta"><a name="871107a"></a>(a) In a contract for an amount less than $2,500, when determined necessary by the Director, Regional Office, the contracting officer may include the following:</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">The contractor expressly waives any and all rights to file or maintain any mechanics lien or claim against the aforesaid premises.</p>
