         <p class="p List3">(iii) Other sources that were considered.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) A description of work to be performed or products to be furnished.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) The estimated or agreed contract price.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi) A citation of the appropriation available.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vii) A statement of whether the contractor has commenced performance.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(viii) The name of the individual responsible for the unauthorized commitment.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The contracting officer will review the file and forward it to the approving authority specified in paragraph (b) of this section with any comments or information that the approving authority should consider in evaluating the request for ratification. If the approving authority determines that a legal review would be desirable, the approving authority will coordinate the request for ratification with OGC or the Regional Counsel, as appropriate.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) If the approving authority authorizes the ratification, the approving authority will return the file to the contracting officer for issuance of a purchase order or contract, as appropriate.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) If an otherwise proper contract award exceeds the limits of the contracting officer's delegated authority, the ratifying contracting officer must comply with the above requirements and the approving authority must inform the HCA. The HCA will take action to preclude future instances of such awards.

         <span class="ph autonumber">801.602-70</span> General review requirements.</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Contracting officers shall ensure that any document listed under 801.602-71 through 801.602-76 that is submitted for technical or legal review is submitted through or by an official at least one level above the contracting officer.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Before opening a bid, awarding a contract, or signing a contract-related document as specified in 801.602-71 through 801.602-76, the contracting officer shall ensure that the appropriate VA official, including appropriate staff of the Acquisition Resources Service regional or VA Central Office, has reviewed and concurred with the document.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Before signing a contract for a Veterans Benefits Administration field facility for any guidance center or vocational rehabilitation service with an anticipated expenditure of $100,000 or more, the contracting officer shall ensure that the Director, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Service, has reviewed and approved the solicitation or proposed contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) When the following items are for the management, sale, or lease of properties acquired by VA after liquidation of a guaranteed, direct, acquired, or vendee loan, the review requirements specified in 801.602-71 through 801.602-76 do not apply:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Agreements.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Licenses.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Easements.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Deeds.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) If there is insufficient time for the legal review required in 801.602-75(a)(3), the contracting officer (except contracting officers in the Office of Construction and Facilities Management) must at least obtain verbal concurrence from Acquisition Resources Service staff before issuing a change order where:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The change order (unilateral agreement) has an anticipated value of $100,000 or more; or
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The change order is for a time extension of 60 days or more.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Unless otherwise stated, all dollar values in 801.602-71 through 801.602-76 are expressed in total dollars involved in the acquisition action.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The contracting officer may not consider the positive and negative status of the figures in determining the total dollar values involved.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) An acquisition of $550,000 with a trade-in credit of $70,000 would be valued at $620,000 for legal or technical review purposes rather than the net amount of $480,000. An Energy Savings Performance Contract requiring payment from savings of $10,000,000 to the contractor over the life of the contract would be valued at $10,000,000, despite the fact that there is no immediate cost to VA and no payment if there are no savings.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) By separate notice, the DSPE may require technical review of any contract-related materials, regardless of dollar value.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h) Except as set forth in 801.602-73 and 801.602-75, at its discretion, the Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management may request OGC review.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) The requirements of this section or sections 801.602-71 through 801.602-76 do not apply to contracts awarded by or on behalf of the VA Office of Inspector General.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(j) Contracting officers and purchase card holders must ensure compliance with separate guidance on information technology (IT) tracking and approval prior to processing requests for acquisitions of IT and telecommunications software, equipment, and/or services, regardless of dollar value.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) In addition to the general review requirements in 801.602-71, contracting officers must obtain technical reviews from Acquisition Resources Service staff of any proposed agreement that is unique, novel, or unusual.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Contracting officers must obtain technical reviews from Acquisition Resources Service staff of the following:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Documents relating to bonds (see FAR 28.102-1 and 28.203 through 28.203-5) as follows:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) An irrevocable letter of credit.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) A tripartite escrow agreement.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) An individual surety bond. (Note that the FAR at 28.203(f) also requires legal review of the documents pledging the assets of an individual surety.)
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Proposed novation and change-of-name agreements (see FAR Subpart 42.12).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Solicitations or proposed contracts containing an economic price adjustment clause (other than a pre-approved VA clause) based on a cost index of material or labor (e.g., the urban consumer price index (CPI-U) (see FAR 16.203-4(d)) or where one of the economic price adjustment clauses specified in FAR 16.203-4 are used.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Proposed multi-year contracts where the cancellation ceiling exceeds 20 percent of the contract amount, regardless of the dollar value of the proposed contract (see 817.105-1(b)).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Proposed solicitations where the contract term total of the basic and option periods may exceed 5 years, regardless of the dollar value of the proposed acquisition (see 817.204).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Proposed membership agreements in a group purchasing organization.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) A proposed termination settlement or determination of amounts due the contractor under a terminated contract that involves the expenditure of $100,000 or more of Government funds. Acquisition Resources Service staff shall obtain legal review (see 849.111-70).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8) Consignment agreements with an anticipated expenditure of $250,000 or more per year (except for a consignment agreement established under, and provided for in, a Federal Supply Schedule contract).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Contracting officers, including purchase card holders, must obtain technical and legal review of all proposed contracts with hotels or similar facilities for conferences or similar functions (e.g., training, meetings) where VA's commitment, expenditure, and liability (combined) exceed $25,000. This dollar figure is based on the combination of all direct costs to VA under the contract (e.g., conference rooms, audio-visual charges, refreshments, catering) and all potential liability (e.g., room guarantee liability, cancellation costs). Even if there is no direct cost to VA, if the proposed contract includes a guarantee on room usage or a cancellation fee that could potentially exceed $25,000, the proposed contract requires legal and technical review. Signing a contract committing VA to hold a conference at a particular hotel is a procurement and procurement laws and regulations must be followed.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Each contract termination, final decision, cure letter, or “show cause” notice proposed under any contract where the total value of the contract is $100,000 or more. A contracting officer may not sign or release a document subject to this provision until OGC has concurred.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Each proposed contract modification, including any proposed modification to a supply or service contract, where the total value of the modification is $100,000 or more (e.g., a modification for a $60,000 increase and a $50,000 decrease equals $110,000). Contract modifications issued only to exercise contract options are exempt from this review requirement.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Each proposed contract modification granting a time extension of more than 60 days. The Director, Acquisition Resources Service, may waive the pre-approval requirement under this paragraph for an individual facility when the Director determines that the facility has obtained appropriate “consideration” for past time extensions and the extensions were otherwise appropriately granted.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Each proposed modification increasing the value of a letter contract, regardless of dollar value.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Each proposed contract modification for which the contractor takes exception to the accord and satisfaction language specified by VA. The contracting officer may not execute any proposed contract modification under this requirement until the contracting officer receives OGC's concurrence in the proposed language.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) An assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8) Each change or revision to a FAR or VAAR provision or clause or an internal VA-approved clause (e.g., architect/engineer “SP” clauses) not specifically authorized by the regulations.

			or (2) of this section, OGC may comment or concur in writing or by telephone.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) When a Central Office contracting activity requests legal assistance, the contracting officer will brief OGC on the facts and points of issue to facilitate prompt resolution.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) For each solicitation or contract awarded and administered by a Central Office contracting activity, that contracting activity will ask OGC to participate in conferences where legal problems or modifications to contract provisions may be considered and in meetings attended by legal representatives of private parties or other Government agencies. The contracting activity will request assigned procurement counsel participation in drafting correspondence involving significant controversial or sensitive contractual matters.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) OGC will prepare any response to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on GAO bid protests. (See 833.104).

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) A business clearance review is a technical review of all solicitation and contract award or modification documents immediately prior to contract award or modification over the specified dollar threshold.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) All VA contracting officers must obtain a business clearance review prior to award of any contract, task or delivery order, or blanket purchase agreement or execution of any contract modification with a value of $5 million or more or prior to award of any lease with a value of $300,000 or more per year.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The dollar threshold in this paragraph is based on the total dollar value of all awards expected under a single solicitation, not the value of each individual award under a solicitation. For example, a solicitation for home oxygen for a Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) might result in multiple awards, each of which has a value of less than $5 million. If the total of all awards under that solicitation will exceed $5 million, the contracting officer must obtain a business clearance review of the entire package, including all proposed individual awards.

The COCP also applies to VA officials granted authority to enter into sales agreements (see separate guidance under VA's Directives Management System).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) A Certificate of Appointment is not required for a contracting officer designated in 801.670 who exercises special and limited delegations of authority.

         <p class="p List1">(c) Warrant levels are synonymous with the Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting Program certification levels specified in the OFPP Memorandum dated January 20, 2006, titled “The Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting Program.” The COCP is based on the following levels and types of authority:

         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Level I warrant.</em> Authority for expenditures at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (see FAR 2.101) for open market contracts, blanket purchase agreements, basic ordering agreements, and delivery/task orders against established contracts (except Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts), within the specified geographical limits of the contracting officer's warrant. For FSS contracts, Level I warrant authority includes authority for expenditures up to the maximum order threshold of the FSS contract, within the specified geographical limits of the contracting officer's warrant. This level was formally titled “Basic” and any current Basic Level warrant need not be reissued solely to change the title.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Level II warrant.</em> Authority for expenditures at or below $5,000,000 or as stated on Standard Form 1402 for open market contracts, blanket purchase agreements, basic ordering agreements, and delivery/task orders against established contracts, within the specified geographic limits of the contracting officer's warrant. This level was formally titled “Intermediate” and any current Intermediate Level warrant need not be reissued solely to change the title.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Level III (Senior Limited) warrant.</em> Authority for expenditures at or below the dollar threshold and within the geographical limits specified on the contracting officer's warrant, Standard Form 1402. This level was formally titled “Senior Limited” and any current Senior Limited Level warrant need not be reissued solely to change the title.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Level III (Senior Unlimited) warrant.</em> Authority granted to VA's contracting officers in contracting activities (e.g., the VA National Acquisition Center, Hines, IL, and Acquisition Operations Service, VA Central Office, Washington, DC) that are charged with meeting Department-wide acquisition needs of VA and its customers. The authority is for expenditures at any dollar level without geographical restriction. This level was formally titled “Senior Unlimited” and any current Senior Unlimited Level warrant need not be reissued solely to change the title.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) <em class="ph i">Multi-VISN.</em> Authority at the Level II warrant and Level III (Senior Limited) warrant levels, granted by the DSPE, that permits procurement consolidations among Veterans Health Administration VISNs, Veterans Benefits Administration Area Offices, and other Government agencies that exist outside the contracting officer's normally assigned geographical area of appointed authority. Multi-VISN authority is generally granted to contracting officers for procurement-specific requirements or to contracting officers who are members of groups or consortiums established for regional contracting initiatives.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Micro-purchase Level.</em> Micro-purchase Level authority, not to exceed the micro-purchase threshold (currently $3,000) ($2,500 for acquisition of services subject to the Service Contract Act, and $2,000 for acquisition of construction subject to the Davis Bacon Act) (see FAR 2.101), is separately addressed under VA's purchase card program. Under that program, the HCA may delegate authority to a VA employee as a purchase card holder through the issuance of VA Form 0242.

			Contracting officers and non-warranted contract specialists who have completed the core training requirements shall obtain a minimum of 80 CLPs of continuing education or training every two fiscal years to stay abreast of current acquisition knowledge and skills as mandated by OFPP. The HCA (for Level I warrant contracting officers) and the Chief, ATCD (for Level II warrant and Level III warrant contracting officers), shall make written determinations every October 1 for each warranted contracting officer on whether the required CLPs, as specified in OFPP guidance, were completed during the two prior fiscal years.

The Chief, ATCD, shall assign CLP values to training taken by Level II warrant and Level III warrant contracting officers for training that does not have pre-assigned CLP or CEU values assigned to the training by the provider.

				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			VA contracting officers, regardless of grade level, who currently hold Level I, Level II, or Level III (Senior Limited or Unlimited) warrants are considered as having met the Experience, Education, and Training requirements for their respective warrant levels. This includes transfers or laterals to other VA contracting activities with similar geographical restrictions. Contracting officers who are promoted up to a GS-12 can maintain their current warrant level authority.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) This Grandfather provision does not cover new VA employees, current VA employees who are not warranted, former VA employees who held contracting authority at their previous Federal Government agencies or VA positions, or VA employees whose warrants have been rescinded or have expired. VA contracting officers who are promoted to GS 13-and-above will no longer be covered by this Grandfather provision and, therefore, must meet the current Experience, Education, and Training requirements for the specific warrant authority that they currently hold or to which they wish to be appointed. Contracting officers requesting a higher level warrant (e.g., from Level I warrant to Level II warrant or from Level III (Senior Limited) warrant to Level III (Senior Unlimited) warrant) must also meet the current Experience, Education, and Training requirement for the specific warrant authority requested.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) This Grandfather provision for retaining a contracting officer's current warrant authority is voided if the contracting officer does not fully meet the minimum Skills Currency requirement prior to warrant expiration or when the warrant authority is suspended or revoked. The contracting officer will then need to meet all of the current warrant prerequisites before a new warrant can be issued or before the suspended or revoked warrant can be reinstated.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h) The training requirements for contracting officers whose delegated authority is limited to the acquisition of transportation services, as provided in part 102-117 of title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, the Federal Management Regulation, shall be as specified therein.
