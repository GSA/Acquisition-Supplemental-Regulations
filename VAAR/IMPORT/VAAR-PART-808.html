The United States, Winston-Salem Industries for the Blind, issued October 17, 2018 and mandated on May 20, 2019. The mandate issued by the Federal Circuit created a binding circuit precedent that, when a product or service is on the AbilityOne Procurement List and ordinarily would result in award under the JWOD program, the Act instead unambiguously requires that priority be given to Veteran-owned small businesses. VAAR 808.603 is also revised. Though the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) priority for use of mandatory Government sources set forth at <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/part-8-required-sources-supplies-and-services#i8_002" title="View FAR 8.002">FAR 8.002(a)(iii)</a> and <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/part-8-required-sources-supplies-and-services#i1117091" title="View FAR subpart 8.6">FAR subpart 8.6</a> was not specifically at issue in the Federal Circuit case, the application of the rationale in the cited case would logically apply to FPI in relation to the Act.  For supplies, FPI is a higher priority than the AbilityOne (JWOD) priority at <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/part-8-required-sources-supplies-and-services#i8_002" title="View FAR 8.002">FAR 8.002(a)(iv)</a> and <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/part-8-required-sources-supplies-and-services#i1116916" title="View FAR subpart 8.7">FAR subpart 8.7</a>.

The United States, Winston-Salem Industries for the Blind, issued October 17, 2018 and mandated on May 20, 2019. The mandate issued by the Federal Circuit created a binding circuit precedent that, when a product or service is on the AbilityOne Procurement List and ordinarily would result in award under the JWOD program, the Act instead unambiguously requires that priority be given to Veteran-owned small businesses. VAAR 808.603 is also revised. Though the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) priority for use of mandatory Government sources set forth at <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/part-8-required-sources-supplies-and-services#i8_002" title="View FAR 8.002">FAR 8.002(a)(iii)</a> and <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/part-8-required-sources-supplies-and-services#i1117091" title="View FAR subpart 8.6">FAR subpart 8.6</a> was not specifically at issue in the Federal Circuit case, the application of the rationale in the cited case would logically apply to FPI in relation to the Act.  For supplies, FPI is a higher priority than the AbilityOne (JWOD) priority at <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/part-8-required-sources-supplies-and-services#i8_002" title="View FAR 8.002">FAR 8.002(a)(iv)</a> and <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/part-8-required-sources-supplies-and-services#i1116916" title="FAR subpart 8.7">FAR subpart 8.7</a>. VA previously amended the VAAR to allow the agency the discretion to award to a Veteran-owned small business when award otherwise would have been made to FPI.]</p>
